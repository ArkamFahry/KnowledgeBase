- # Graph Coloring Algorithms: Art of Graph Coloring
	- A graph colouring algorithm is a method for assigning colours to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.
	- ## Many different graph colouring algorithms.
		- Greedy algorithm
			- This algorithm starts by assigning a random colour to each vertex. Then, it repeatedly iterates through the vertices, and if a vertex is adjacent to a vertex of the same colour, then it assigns the vertex a new colour. This process continues until all of the vertices have been assigned a colour.
		- Backtracking algorithm
			- This algorithm starts by assigning a colour to the first vertex. Then, it recursively assigns colours to the remaining vertices, making sure that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour. If the algorithm reaches a vertex that it cannot assign a colour to, then it backtracks and tries a different assignment.
		- Genetic algorithm
			- This algorithm uses a technique called genetic programming to search for a good colouring of the graph. The algorithm starts with a population of random colourings, and then it repeatedly applies genetic operators to the population, such as mutation and crossover. This process continues until the algorithm finds a colouring that satisfies the constraints.
	- ## The Graph Coloring Problem is [[NP-complete]]
		- This means that there is no known [[Polynomial-Time Algorithm]] that can solve it for all graphs. However, there are many efficient algorithms that can solve the problem for many practical graphs.
	- ## Graph Coloring Algorithm Use cases
		- Scheduling
			- Graph colouring can be used to schedule tasks on a number of machines, such that no two tasks that share resources are scheduled on the same machine.
		- Load balancing
			- Graph colouring can be used to balance the load on a number of servers, such that no two servers have too much work.
		- Circuit design
			- Graph colouring can be used to design circuits that are resistant to errors.
