# Algebra
	- Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It involves using letters and other symbols to represent numbers and quantities in equations and expressions. These symbols can represent unknown values, allowing us to solve for those values using various techniques.
	- ## Breakdown of some key concepts in Algebra
		- **Variables**
			- In algebra, letters like $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$ are used to represent variables, which are quantities that can vary or change. These letters can represent unknown values that we want to find.
		- **Expressions**
			- An algebraic expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). For example, $$3x + 5$$ is an algebraic expression where $$3$$ and $$5$$ are constants, and $$x$$ is a variable.
		- **Equations**
			- An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. It consists of two algebraic expressions separated by an equals sign ($$=$$). For example, $$2x + 3 = 9$$ is an equation.
		- **Solving Equations**
			- To solve an equation means to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. This is done by applying various operations to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. For example, to solve the equation $$2x + 3 = 9$$, you would subtract $$3$$ from both sides to get $$2x = 6$$, then divide by $$2$$ to get $$x = 3$$.
		- **Inequalities**
			- Inequalities compare two expressions and show their relationship using symbols like $$<$$ (less than), $$>$$ (greater than), $$\leq$$ (less than or equal to), and $$\geq$$ (greater than or equal to). For example, $$2x < 8$$ is an inequality.
		- **Graphing**
			- Algebraic expressions and equations can be graphed on a coordinate plane. This allows us to visualize relationships between variables and see how they change.
		- **Functions**
			- A function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. In algebra, functions are often represented by equations. For example, $$f(x) = 2x + 1$$ represents a linear function.
	- Algebra is a fundamental part of mathematics and is used in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science to model and solve real-world problems.
