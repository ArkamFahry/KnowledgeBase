# Data Modeling
	- Data modeling is a process used in designing databases or structuring data systems to organize and understand information effectively. It involves creating a conceptual representation of how data should be structured, stored, and accessed within an organization or system.
	- ## Types of data models
		- **Conceptual Model**
			- This represents the high-level view of the entire data environment. It focuses on entities, their relationships, and the business rules governing those relationships, without considering specific technical details.
		- **Logical Model**
			- This delves deeper into the structure, defining entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. It's more detailed than the conceptual model but doesn’t include implementation specifics.
		- **Physical Model**
			- This is the actual implementation of the logical model in a specific database management system (DBMS). It involves translating the logical model into tables, columns, data types, indexes, etc., based on the requirements of the chosen database technology.
	- Data modeling involves various techniques and tools, such as Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Data Definition Language (DDL). These aid in visually representing data elements, their relationships, and how they interact within the system.
	- The primary goals of data modeling are to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and integrity while optimizing data structures for efficient storage and retrieval. It’s crucial for system architects, database designers, and stakeholders to collaborate during this process to create a model that aligns with business needs and technical requirements.
