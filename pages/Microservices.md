- Microservices is an architectural style used in software development to design and build applications as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service represents a specific business capability and runs as a separate process. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) over a network.
	- ## The key characteristics of microservices are
		- Decentralization
			- In a microservices architecture, there is no central monolithic application. Instead, the application is broken down into smaller, individual services, each responsible for its specific functionality.
		- Modularity
			- Each microservice is a self-contained unit, focused on a single task or business capability. This modularity allows teams to work independently on different services, which can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.
		- Independence
			- Microservices are designed to be loosely coupled. This means that changes in one service do not directly impact other services. This flexibility makes it easier to update and maintain the system without affecting the entire application.
		- Scalability
			- Since services are independent, they can be scaled individually based on the demand for that particular service. This enables better resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.
		- Technology Diversity
			- Different services within a microservices-based application can use different technologies and programming languages, as long as they can communicate through APIs.
		- Resilience
			- When one service fails, it does not bring down the entire application. Failures are isolated, and the system can continue functioning, albeit with reduced functionality.
		- Ease of Deployment
			- Microservices facilitate continuous delivery and deployment practices. Teams can independently deploy their services without having to coordinate with other teams.
		- Focused Teams
			- Each service can be developed and maintained by a small, dedicated team, making it easier to manage and understand the codebase.
- Microservices are often used in large and complex applications, where a monolithic architecture might become unwieldy and difficult to manage. However, adopting microservices also introduces challenges related to inter-service communication, data consistency, and system monitoring. Proper planning, design, and governance are essential to successfully implement and manage a microservices-based application.
