- # Git Commit
	- n Git, a commit is a snapshot of changes made to a repository at a specific time. When you make changes to files within a Git repository, you'll stage those changes and then create a commit to save them permanently to the Git history. A commit includes a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash), a commit message describing the changes made, and references to the changes themselves.
	- Commits are essential for tracking the history of a project and allowing collaboration among multiple developers. They help in reverting to previous states of the project, reviewing changes, and understanding the evolution of the codebase over time. Each commit represents a point in the project's history, forming a timeline of changes.
