# FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
	- FFI refers to a mechanism that enables code written in one programming language to call or use functions and data structures defined in another language. It's commonly used when integrating code written in different programming languages or when utilizing libraries or modules written in languages other than the primary one.
	- For example, if you have a program primarily written in Python and want to use a library written in C or C++, you can use FFI to create a bridge between the Python code and the C/C++ library. This allows the Python program to invoke functions or use data structures defined in the C/C++ library.
	- FFI implementations vary across different programming languages. Some languages provide built-in support for FFI, while others might rely on external tools or libraries to facilitate communication between different language environments. It's a powerful tool for interoperability, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of different languages within a single project.
