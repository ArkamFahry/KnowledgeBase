- # PGWarp
	- A custom implementation of [[CDC]] which subscribes to the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] and pushes these changes into [[NATS]] building a real-time reactive event pipeline for [[PostgreSQL]].
	- ## PGWarp Technical Terms
		- Snapshot
			- Snapshot is the process of scanning a full table in [[PostgreSQL]] to get all the data from a table which doesn't exist in the [[PostgreSQL WAL]].
		- Stream
			- stream is used to describe a stream of event changes from a [[PostgreSQL]] table like `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `truncate` and `snapshot`.
	- ## PGWap Requirements
		- Watch the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] and publish those [[WAL]] events in to [[NATS]].
		- [[NATS Subject]] mappings for the events would look like `[database].[schema].[table]`. This can be overridden by custom event mapping or a table could get a totally custom subject name if it's manually defined.
		- Persistent and Ephemeral streams.
			- A stream will default to being persistent but this can be modified per table marking it's  stream as persistent or ephemeral.
			- A persistent stream would be using [[NATS JetStream]] instance.
			- A ephemeral stream would be using [[NATS PubSub]] instance.
		- Snapshots and Incremental-Snapshots.
