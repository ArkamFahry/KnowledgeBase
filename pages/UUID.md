# UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
	- UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It's a 128-bit identifier that is globally unique and standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). UUIDs are used to uniquely identify information without a centralized authority assigning them.
	- UUIDs are represented by 32 hexadecimal digits displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, like this: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000`.
	- They're generated using various algorithms, taking into account time, location, and other factors to ensure uniqueness. One commonly used method is Version 4 UUIDs, which are generated using random or pseudo-random numbers.
	- The uniqueness of UUIDs makes them extremely valuable in various computing scenarios, especially in distributed systems where multiple sources need to generate unique identifiers without coordination. They're used in databases, software development, and network protocols to uniquely identify entities such as documents, users, or resources.
