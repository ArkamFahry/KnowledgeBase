# Low Cardinality
	- Low cardinality refers to a situation where a dataset or a specific column within a dataset contains a relatively small number of unique values compared to the total number of rows.
	- In simpler terms, a dataset with low cardinality has limited diversity or variation in its values. For instance, if you have a column representing "gender" in a dataset and it only contains two unique values, such as "male" and "female," it has low cardinality.
	- Low cardinality is often encountered in categorical or qualitative data where there are only a few distinct categories or classes. This can also be seen in columns like "day of the week," "country names," or "yes/no" type columns, where the number of unique values is limited.
	- ## Relevance of Low cardinality in a data-related context
		- **Impact on Analysis**
			- Low cardinality columns might not offer much insight or variability in certain types of analysis or machine learning models. For instance, a column with only one or two unique values won't provide much discriminatory power in predictive modeling.
		- **Memory and Processing Efficiency**
			- Low cardinality columns might be more efficiently stored and processed, requiring less memory compared to high cardinality columns with numerous unique values.
		- **Categorical Encoding**
			- Low cardinality is also important when encoding categorical data for machine learning models. One-hot encoding, for instance, could lead to less complexity when dealing with low cardinality columns.
	- However, in some cases, low cardinality can still be crucial and informative for certain analyses. Understanding the context of the data and its relationship to the problem being solved is essential to determine whether low cardinality is a limitation or a valuable aspect of the dataset.
