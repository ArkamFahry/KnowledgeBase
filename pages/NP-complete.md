- # NP-complete
	- NP-complete is a class of decision problems that are believed to be as hard as any other problem in NP. A decision problem is a problem that can be answered with a yes or no answer. NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, which means that a problem can be solved in polynomial time if a nondeterministic Turing machine is allowed to guess the correct answer and then verify that the answer is correct.
	- ## How does a Problem become NP-complete
		- A problem is NP-complete if it satisfies the following two conditions.
			- The problem is in NP, meaning that there is a [[Polynomial-Time Algorithm]] that can verify a solution.
			- Every problem in NP can be reduced to a problem in polynomial time.
		- In simple terms, if there is a polynomial-time algorithm for solving an NP-complete problem, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm for solving every problem in NP.
	- ## Well known NP-complete problems
		- The travelling salesman problem
			- Given a list of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits all of the cities.
		- The Boolean satisfiability problem
			- Given a Boolean formula, determine if there is an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the formula true.
		- The knapsack problem
			- Given a set of items with weights and values, and a knapsack with a limited capacity, find the subset of items that has the highest value and that fits in the knapsack.
	- ## Approaches for solving NP-complete problems
		- Greedy algorithms:
			- These algorithms find a solution that is good enough, but not necessarily optimal.
		- Heuristic algorithms
			- These algorithms use heuristics to search for a good solution.
		- Randomized algorithms
			- These algorithms use randomness to search for a good solution.
