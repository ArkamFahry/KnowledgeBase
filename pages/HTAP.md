- # HTAP: Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing
	- HTAP stands for Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing. It is a modern approach to database architecture that aims to support both transactional and analytical workloads in a single system. Traditional database systems often use separate databases or systems for transaction processing ([[OLTP]]) and analytical processing ([[OLAP]]), leading to data duplication, complexity, and potentially inconsistent results. HTAP systems seek to overcome these limitations by providing a unified platform for both types of workloads.
	- ## Key characteristics of HTAP systems
		- **Transactional and Analytical Workloads**
			- HTAP systems are designed to handle both transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) workloads. This means that they can process transactions in real time while also supporting complex analytical queries on the same data.
		- **Real-Time Analytics**
			- One of the key features of HTAP systems is the ability to perform real-time analytics on transactional data. This allows organizations to gain insights from their data immediately, without the need to wait for batch processing or data extraction.
		- **Data Consistency**
			- HTAP systems ensure that both transactional and analytical queries see a consistent view of the data. This is achieved through various techniques, such as maintaining a single copy of the data and using snapshot isolation for transactions.
		- **High Performance**
			- HTAP systems are designed for high performance, both in terms of transaction processing and analytical queries. They often use in-memory processing, parallel processing, and other optimization techniques to achieve this.
		- **Complex Queries**
			- HTAP systems are capable of handling complex analytical queries, such as aggregations, joins, and window functions, on large datasets. This allows organizations to perform sophisticated data analysis in real time.
		- **Use Cases**
			- HTAP systems are well-suited for use cases where real-time analytics are important, such as fraud detection, risk management, and real-time reporting. They are also useful in scenarios where transactional and analytical workloads need to coexist, such as in e-commerce or financial systems.
	- In summary, HTAP systems provide a unified platform for both transactional and analytical processing, offering real-time analytics, data consistency, high performance, and support for complex queries. They are a powerful tool for organizations looking to gain insights from their data in real time while maintaining the integrity of their transactional systems.
