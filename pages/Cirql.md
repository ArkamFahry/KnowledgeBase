	- ## [[Cirql Usage]]
		- Following query fetches up to 5 organisations that are enabled and have the given user as a member. The result is parsed and validated using the provided [[Zod Schema]]
			- ```typescript
			  import { RecordSchema, select } from 'cirql';
			  import { z } from 'zod';
			  
			  // Define your Zod schemas
			  const Organisation = RecordSchema.extend({
			      name: z.string(),
			      isEnabled: z.boolean(),
			      createdAt: z.string()
			  });
			  
			  // Execute a select query
			  const organisations = await cirql.execute({
			      query: select()
			          .from('organisation')
			          .with(Organisation) // Specify the schema
			          .limit(5)
			          .where({
			              isEnabled: true,
			              members: any(userId)
			          })
			  });
			  ```
