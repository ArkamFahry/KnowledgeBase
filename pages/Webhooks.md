# Webhooks: Realtime push based [[API]] for [[Events]]
	- Webhooks are a method of real-time communication between two web applications or services. They allow one application to send automatic, event-based notifications to another application when a specific event occurs. This way, the receiving application can take immediate action based on the event without the need for constant polling.
	- ## To explain webhooks in detail, let's break down the process and the key components involved
		- Event Occurrence
			- A webhook is triggered when a specific event occurs in the sender application. The events can vary depending on the service, but common examples include a new user registration, a payment processed, a file uploaded, a status update, etc.
		- Webhook Registration
			- Before the sender application can send notifications, the receiving application needs to "register" or set up a webhook. The registration typically involves providing a URL (endpoint) where the sender will make POST requests when an event occurs.
		- HTTP Requests
			- When the event occurs, the sender application creates an HTTP POST request containing relevant data about the event and sends it to the URL specified during the webhook registration.
		- Receiving and Processing
			- The receiving application listens for incoming HTTP requests at the specified URL. When the webhook notification arrives, the application processes the payload (data) in the request to understand the event's context and trigger appropriate actions based on the received information.
		- Authentication and Security
			- To ensure the security and integrity of webhooks, both the sender and receiver can use authentication mechanisms, such as API keys, tokens, or signatures. This helps prevent unauthorized access or tampering of data.
		- Response and Retries
			- After receiving the webhook, the receiving application may respond with a status code to acknowledge the successful receipt of the event. If the sender does not receive a successful response, it may attempt to resend the webhook at predefined intervals to ensure delivery.
	- ## Webhooks are widely used in various scenarios and offer several advantages over traditional polling mechanisms:
		- Real-time Updates
			- Webhooks provide instant notifications, allowing applications to respond immediately to events as they happen, without any delay.
		- Efficiency
			- Unlike polling, where applications repeatedly check for new data, webhooks only trigger when there is something relevant to communicate, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.
		- Scalability
			- Webhooks are scalable because the sender application can trigger multiple webhook calls concurrently to different endpoints.
		- Integration
			- They enable seamless integration between different services and systems, promoting interoperability and data flow between applications.
- Popular web services like GitHub, Stripe (payment processing), and Twilio (communication APIs) use webhooks extensively to notify third-party applications about events and changes, enabling developers to build more connected and responsive applications.
