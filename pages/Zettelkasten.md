	- ## Let's first talk about learning
		- Learning is a tool. doing it faster is a super power
		- There is the phrase "knowledge is power" is often attributed to Francis Bacon, from his Meditationes Sacrae (1597). This most likely corresponded to transmitting the idea that having and sharing knowledge is the cornerstone of reputation, influence, and power. So learning can give you knowledge of which intern would make you powerful and who doesn't like to be powerful in a good way.
		- This is all going to be about learning. Not normal learning. It's time to get into a proven system, a time-tested method of increasing productivity, learning faster, and growing creativity. A process of collecting thoughts, taking notes, and creating a lifelong Second Brain if that sounds useful let's get cracking.

	- ## What is a Zettelkasten
		- Zettelkasten means "Slip Box" method.
		- This highly effective knowledge management methodology originated from [Conrad Gessner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner) a Swiss scientist from 1500s.
		- Modern researchers like [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) who wrote [400 research articles and over 70 books](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=author:Niklas+author:Luhmann), continues to prove the viability and efficiency of this methodology. His Zettelkasten had a mindboggling 90,000 index cards which were built up over 40 years. This is just one such example of Zettelkasten, or Second Brain which has given near superhuman capability to researchers.

		- ### The philosophy behind the Zettelkasten
			- The method involves building a set of networked and connected notes, linking ideas, thoughts, and information, which tries to mimic how the human brain functions.
			- At the core of the Zettelkasten philosophy assumes better organization, better note recall, and improved processes for idea generation help drive productivity.
