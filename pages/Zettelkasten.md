	- ## What is a Zettelkasten
		- Zettelkasten means "Slip Box" method.
		- This highly effective knowledge management methodology originated from [Conrad Gessner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner) a Swiss scientist from 1500s.
		- Modern researchers like [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) who wrote [400 research articles and over 70 books](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=author:Niklas+author:Luhmann), continues to prove the viability and efficiency of this methodology. His Zettelkasten had a mindboggling 90,000 index cards which were built up over 40 years. This is just one such example of Zettelkasten, or Second Brain which has given near superhuman capability to researchers.

		- ### The philosophy behind the Zettelkasten
			- At the core of the Zettelkasten philosophy assumes better organization, better note recall, and improved processes for idea generation help drive productivity.
			- The method involves building a set of networked and connected notes, linking ideas, thoughts, and information, which tries to mimic how the human brain functions. Each note or "slip" in a Zettelkasten represents a single idea or topic. Each note is connected to related ideas through a network of notes. These notes should preferably be [[Atomic Notes]].
			- Note topics can naturally develop during research, brainstorming, studying, or generally anywhere at any time. So there are no limits or bounds to this. The larger a Zettelkasten grows more powerful it becomes by allowing the owner to follow threads, unlock new connections, and explore new sequential thoughts.
			- Traditionally researchers wrote on paper notecards and filed them by hand in boxes and cabinets as shown belove. Which looked like a pile of cluttered trash to outsiders, but all those organized notes support a clean, structured mind with idea-generating resources.

			- But now there are digital tools like Logseq, and Obsidian to build 
			  a Zettelkasten which will negate all the complexity of a physical system.
	- ### Foundational concepts of Zettelkasten
		- **Notes contain discrete pieces of information**
			- One note per topic or thought. This structure the note cleanly and limits the information to a few sentence or paragraph. The notes should be a [[Atomic Notes]].
		- **Notes are organized by location and there are no categories**
			- This is quite nuanced. With a physical Zettelkasten, categorizing a topic is a nightmare, because a single note could belong to multiple categories. Let's say "Toyota Supra 2JZ 1998" This can belong to Sports cars and Toyota cars this would be a pain to categorize in a physical Zettelkasten, But in modern Zettelkasten they can be arranged with tags and links to multiple categorize at once.
		- **Notes have clear, unique titles**
			- Use descriptive words or a time or some form of unique. Duplicate names are a no-no.
		- **All notes should be linked**
			- A note without a link becomes an orphan which wanders like a sad stray thought we get at 2 A.M at night. Linked notes are happy notes which make the owner of the Zettelkasten happy.
		- **Keywords are cross-referenced**
			- Our prolific Dr Luhmann built a reference guide to help him find important keywords and their associated notes. This is a time-consuming process with physical cards but is automatic for a digital Zettelkasten with tags, links and, search capabilities.
