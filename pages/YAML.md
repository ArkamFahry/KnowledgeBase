# YAML
	- YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language." It's a human-readable data serialization format that is commonly used for configuration files. YAML is often used in applications where data needs to be stored or transmitted in a format that is easily readable by both humans and machines.
	- YAML uses indentation and a clean, human-readable syntax without the use of brackets or commas, relying on whitespace and line breaks to structure data. This makes YAML files quite readable and straightforward for configuration purposes.
	- ## Key features of YAML
		- **Readability:** YAML's structure is easy for humans to understand due to its clean and minimal syntax. It uses indentation to represent data hierarchy.
		- **Data Types:** YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries (key-value pairs), booleans, null values, and more.
		- **Comments:** YAML allows comments, denoted by the `#` symbol, which helps in providing additional context or explanations within the configuration files.
		- **Common Usage:** It's commonly used in configuration files for applications, including Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Ansible, and many other tools and platforms.
	- ## Simple example for YAML
		- ```yaml
		  # Example of a YAML file
		  person:
		    name: John Doe
		    age: 30
		    interests:
		      - programming
		      - reading
		      - hiking
		  ```
			- In this `person` is a dictionary with `name`, `age`, and `interests` as its keys. `interests` is a list containing multiple values.
	- YAML's simplicity and readability make it a popular choice for configuration files across various programming languages and systems.
