	- ## What is NutsDB
		- NutsDB is a simple, fast, embeddable and persistent key/value store written in pure Go.
		- It supports fully serializable transactions and many data structures such as lists, sets, and sorted sets. All operations happen inside a Tx. Tx represents a transaction, which can be read-only or read-write. Read-only transactions can read values for a given bucket and a given key or iterate over a set of key-value pairs. Read-write transactions can read, update and delete keys from the DB.
		- The code base of NutsDB is understandable so this can be used as starting point for understanding database design.
	- ## Features of NutsDB
		- Simple
			- It is a simple and easy-to-use key/value store. It has a straightforward API that makes it easy to get started.
		- Fast
			- NutsDB is a fast key/value store. It can handle a high volume of transactions with low latency.
		- Embeddable
			- It is an embeddable key/value store. This means that you can easily embed it in your own Go applications.
		- Persistent
			- It is a persistent key/value store. This means that your data will be saved even if your application crashes.
		- Transactional
			- NutsDB supports fully serializable transactions. This means that you can be sure that your transactions will be executed as expected, even if there are concurrent modifications to the data.
		- Data structures
			- NutsDB supports a variety of data structures, including lists, sets, and sorted sets. This makes it a versatile key/value store that can be used for a variety of applications.
		- Understandable
			- The code base is readable and understandable. So this is a good study material.
