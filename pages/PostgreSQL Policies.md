- # PostgreSQL Policies
	- In PostgreSQL, policies are used to control access to database objects, such as tables and views. Policies are defined on a per-table or per-view basis and allow you to specify rules that determine which rows or columns users are allowed to access, update, insert, or delete. Policies are a part of the row-level security (RLS) feature in PostgreSQL.
	- ## key concepts related to PostgreSQL policies
		- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
			- [[PostgreSQL RLS]] is a feature that enables you to control access to rows in database tables based on the characteristics of the user executing a query. It allows you to define policies that determine which rows a user can access.
		- **Table-Level Policies**
			- Policies in PostgreSQL are defined at the table level. Each table can have multiple policies, and each policy consists of a set of rules that define the conditions under which a user is allowed to access or modify rows in the table.
		- **Policy Rules**
			- A policy rule is a condition that determines whether a user is allowed to access certain rows in a table. Rules are specified using SQL conditions and can reference columns in the table, allowing for fine-grained control over access.
		- **Policy Commands**
			- Policies are created and managed using the `CREATE POLICY` and `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE/DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` commands. The `CREATE POLICY` command allows you to define the rules for a policy on a specific table, specifying whether the rules apply for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.
	- ## Basic example for creating a policy
		- ```sql
		  -- Enable row-level security on a table
		  ALTER TABLE your_table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
		  -- Create a policy that allows users to select rows where the 'user_id' column matches their own user ID
		  CREATE POLICY select_policy
		  USING (user_id = current_user)
		  FOR SELECT
		  TO your_role;
		  -- Apply the policy to the table
		  ALTER TABLE your_table_name FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
		  ```
		- In this example, the policy named `select_policy` allows users with the specified role (`your_role`) to select only those rows where the `user_id` column matches their own user ID.
	- Policies provide a powerful mechanism for implementing row-level security in PostgreSQL, allowing you to enforce access control based on specific conditions and user attributes.
