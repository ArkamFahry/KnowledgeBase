# Algorithms
	- ### What is algorithm in [[DSA]]
		- Let's say your going to play a game. What steps do you follow
			- On the PC -> Check if game is installed -> if yes start the game -> if no do we want to pirate the game -> if yes pirate -> if no just don't play
		- Above we did the steps to play a game which is simple problem solving operation. we are providing a step-by-step procedure for solving it.
		- **Formal definition of an algorithm**
			- An algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem

		- In the traditional study of algorithms, there are two main criteria for judging the merits of algorithms correctness (does the algorithm give solution to the problem in a finite number of steps?) and efficiency (how much resources (in terms of memory and time) does it take to execute the).
