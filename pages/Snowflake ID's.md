# Snowflake ID's
	- Snowflake IDs, in general terms, refer to a type of unique identifier designed for distributed systems. They are structured 64-bit unsigned integers used to generate unique IDs across multiple machines or nodes without requiring centralized coordination.
	- ## The typical components of a Snowflake-like ID include
		- **Timestamp**
			- Usually a portion of the bits used to represent a timestamp. It signifies the time of ID generation, allowing for chronological ordering of IDs.
		- **Node or Machine ID**
			- Another section of bits used to identify the machine or node generating the ID. This helps prevent collisions in distributed environments where multiple machines generate IDs simultaneously.
		- **Sequence Number**
			- Typically a set of bits used to represent a sequence number. It increments for each ID generated within the same timestamp and node combination, ensuring uniqueness within the same millisecond for a specific node.
	- Snowflake-like IDs aim to be unique, sortable by time of creation, and generated efficiently across distributed systems without relying on a central authority. They're used in various distributed applications, databases, and systems where unique identification across multiple nodes or machines is essential.
