# JavaScript
	- JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to add interactivity, functionality, and behavior to web pages. It runs in web browsers, enabling dynamic content, user interaction, and the manipulation of webpage elements. In short, it's the language that makes websites interactive and responsive.
	- JavaScript also runs on the server using runtimes like [[Node]], [[Bun]] or [[Deno]] this makes JS good for the frontend and backend.
	- JS can be enhanced with type safety using [[TypeScript]]
