- # Data Structures and Algorithms
	- Data structures and algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental area of computer science that deals with the efficient organization and manipulation of data. It encompasses the study of various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, along with the algorithms that operate on these structures. DSA plays a crucial role in designing and implementing efficient software solutions for a wide range of applications.
	- ## Core Concepts in DSA
		- [[Data Structure]]
			- These are the building blocks for storing and organizing data in a computer's memory. They provide efficient ways to access, insert, delete, and modify data.
		- [[Algorithms]]
			- These are step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. They involve specific operations on data structures to achieve a desired outcome.
		- [[Time and Space Complexity]]
			- These metrics measure the efficiency of algorithms. Time complexity indicates the number of operations an algorithm performs, while space complexity indicates the amount of memory it requires.
	- ## Applications of DSA
