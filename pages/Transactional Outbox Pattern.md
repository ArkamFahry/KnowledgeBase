# Transactional Outbox Pattern
	- The Transactional Outbox Pattern is a technique used in distributed systems to ensure consistency and reliability when dealing with the coordination of multiple actions across different services or components. It's particularly helpful in scenarios where you need to maintain consistency in the face of potential failures or inconsistencies between different parts of a system.
	- In a distributed system, various components or services often need to communicate and perform actions that are interdependent. For instance, when processing an order in an e-commerce system, you might need to update inventory, send confirmation emails, and update the order status. If any of these steps fail or encounter issues, it can lead to inconsistencies in the system.
	- The Transactional Outbox Pattern helps in addressing these challenges by introducing a concept called an "outbox."
	- ## How Transactional Outbox Pattern works
		- **Transactional Operation**
			- When a service needs to perform a series of related actions as part of a transaction, it starts by writing all the required information about these actions into a local outbox within its own transactional boundary.
		- **Database Transaction**
			- Alongside the local transaction, the service writes details of the intended actions into a dedicated "outbox" table within its database. This outbox table stores messages or events that describe the actions that need to be executed by other parts of the system.
		- **Asynchronous Processing**
			- After the local transaction successfully commits, the system reads the messages/events from the outbox table. These messages describe the actions that need to be executed by other services or components in the system.
		- **Reliable Dispatch**
			- The messages from the outbox table are then dispatched or published to a message broker or queue, ensuring that other services or components interested in these actions can consume and process them independently.
		- **Consumption and Processing**
			- Other services or components, upon receiving these messages from the queue, perform the necessary actions they describe, often within their own transactional boundaries.
		- **Idempotent Processing**
			- To handle potential failures and ensure fault tolerance, the consuming services are designed to be idempotent. This means they can safely process the same message multiple times without causing any adverse effects.
	- ## Key benefits of Transactional Outbox Pattern
		- **Atomicity**
			- Actions are either all performed or none, ensuring atomicity within the local transactional boundary.
		- **Decoupling**
			- Services are decoupled and can independently consume and process the messages from the outbox, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.
		- **Reliability**
			- Even if failures occur during message processing, the messages remain in the outbox, allowing for retries and ensuring eventual consistency.
	- However, implementing this pattern requires careful design to handle scenarios like message duplication, idempotent processing, and managing the outbox to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck.
	- ## Example for Transactional Outbox Pattern
		- Certainly! Let's consider an example of an e-commerce system where orders are placed, and various actions need to be taken after an order is successfully processed.
		- Suppose we have a simplified database schema for an online store:
			- **Order Table**
				- order_id
				- customer_id
				- total_amount
				- status
			- **Inventory Table**
				- product_id
				- quantity_available
			- **Outbox Table**
				- id
				- event_type
				- event_data
				- status
				- created_at
		- In this scenario, when a new order is placed, several actions need to occur
			- **Update Order Status**
				- Set the order status to 'Processing'.
			- **Update Inventory**
				- Reduce the available quantity of the purchased products.
			- **Send Confirmation Email**
				- Notify the customer about the order.
		- The Outbox Table will help manage these actions
			- **id**
				- Unique identifier for each outbox entry.
			- **event_type**
				- Describes the type of action to be performed (e.g., 'UpdateOrderStatus', 'UpdateInventory', 'SendConfirmationEmail').
			- **event_data**
				- Contains the necessary data for performing the action (e.g., order_id, product_id, email_content).
			- **status**
				- Indicates the status of the outbox entry (e.g., 'Pending', 'Processed', 'Failed').
			- **created_at**
				- Timestamp indicating when the entry was created.
		- Outbox Table
			- |id|event_type|event_data|status|created_at|
			  |--|--|--|--|--|
			  |1|UpdateOrderStatus|{ order_id: 123, status: 'Processing' }|Pending|2024-01-03 08:00:00|
			  |2|UpdateInventory|{ product_id: 456, quantity: 2 }|Pending|2024-01-03 08:00:05|
			  |3|SendConfirmationEmail|{ order_id: 123, email: 'customer@example.com' }|Pending|2024-01-03 08:00:10|
		- ## Example Outbox Table [[PostgreSQL]]
			- ```sql
			  create or replace function on_events_create()
			      returns trigger as
			  $$
			  begin
			      new.id = 'event_' || gen_random_ulid(); -- gen_random_uuid() or gen_random_ulid()
			      new.version = 0;
			      new.status = 'pending';
			      new.published_at = null;
			      new.failed_at = null;
			      new.failed_reasons = null;
			      new.failed_attempts = 0;
			      new.retried_at = null;
			      new.retried_attempts = 0;
			      new.created_at = now();
			  
			      return new;
			  end;
			  $$ language plpgsql;
			  
			  create table if not exists events
			  (
			      id               text          not null,
			      version          int default 0 not null,
			      aggregate_type   text          not null,
			      event_type       text          not null,
			      payload          jsonb         not null,
			      status           text          not null,
			      published_at     timestamptz   null,
			      failed_at        timestamptz   null,
			      failed_reasons   text[]        null,
			      failed_attempts  int default 0 not null,
			      retried_at       timestamptz   null,
			      retried_attempts int default 0 not null,
			      created_at       timestamptz   not null,
			      constraint events_id_primary_key primary key (id),
			      constraint events_id_version_unique unique (id, version),
			      constraint events_id_check check ( trim(id) <> '' ),
			      constraint events_version_check check ( version >= 0 ),
			      constraint events_aggregate_type_check check ( trim(aggregate_type) <> '' ),
			      constraint events_event_type_check check ( trim(event_type) <> '' ),
			      constraint events_status_check check ( status in ('pending', 'published', 'failed') )
			  );
			  
			  create or replace trigger on_events_create
			      before insert
			      on events
			      for each row
			  execute function on_events_create();
			  ```
		- Once the order is successfully placed, the system starts transactions to update the Order table and the Outbox table. It updates the Order table with the 'Processing' status and populates the Outbox table with entries corresponding to the actions needed.
		- Another process (e.g., a background worker or [[CDC]]) periodically checks the Outbox Table for entries with a 'Pending' status, processes them by executing the intended actions, and updates their status to 'Processed' upon successful completion. If an action fails, the status might be set to 'Failed' for later retry or manual intervention.
		- This Outbox Table allows the system to maintain a record of pending actions that need to be executed, even in the face of potential failures or inconsistencies across different parts of the system, ensuring eventual consistency.
