It's the core component of the Linux operating system, and when combined with other software (such as GNU tools and various applications), it forms a complete operating system known as a Linux distribution or distro.
	- ## Key characteristics of Linux

		- **Security**
			- Linux is known for its robust security features. It has a strong permission and user management system, making it less vulnerable to malware and viruses compared to some other operating systems.
		- **Stability and Performance**
			- It's often used in servers and embedded systems due to its stability, reliability, and performance. Linux is highly customizable and can be optimized for specific hardware and purposes.
		- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
			- Linux offers both CLI and GUI options, giving users flexibility in how they interact with the system. The command line is often favored by experienced users and administrators for its efficiency and power.
		- **Community and Support**
			- The Linux community is vast and active, offering extensive documentation, forums, and support for users at various skill levels.
	- Linux powers a wide range of devices, from servers and supercomputers to smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded systems. Its versatility, stability, and open-source nature have contributed to its widespread adoption and popularity in both the tech industry and among individual users.
