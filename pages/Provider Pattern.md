- # Provider Pattern
	- One of the popular design patterns used in software development is the `Provider Pattern` sometimes referred to as the `Provider Model` However, it is essential to note that this pattern might be called by different names in various programming languages or frameworks.
	- The Provider Pattern is typically used to abstract the creation of objects or services, allowing the flexibility to switch between different implementations at runtime. It enables the decoupling of the client code from the concrete implementation of the service, making the code more maintainable, extensible, and testable.
	- ## Here's a general outline of how the Provider Pattern works
		- Interface
			- Define an interface or an abstract class that represents the service you want to provide. This interface will declare the methods that the provider must implement.
		- Provider Class
			- Create one or more provider classes that implement the interface. Each provider class will provide a different implementation of the service.
		- Provider Registration
			- In some cases, you may need a mechanism to register and manage providers dynamically, allowing you to add or remove providers without modifying the client code.
		- Client Code
			- The client code interacts with the service through the interface without knowing the specific implementation. It requests the service from the provider, and the provider returns the appropriate implementation of the service.
		- Configuration
			- In some cases, the provider used by the client can be determined by configuration settings, environment variables, or other means.
	- ## Examples for the Provider Pattern
		- Simple [[Python]] pseudo-code example
			- ```python
			  # Step 1: Interface
			  class PaymentProvider:
			      def process_payment(self, amount):
			          raise NotImplementedError()
			  
			  # Step 2: Provider Classes
			  class CreditCardPaymentProvider(PaymentProvider):
			      def process_payment(self, amount):
			          # Implement credit card payment logic here
			          print(f"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}")
			  
			  class PayPalPaymentProvider(PaymentProvider):
			      def process_payment(self, amount):
			          # Implement PayPal payment logic here
			          print(f"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}")
			  
			  # Step 3: Provider Registration (not shown in this simple example)
			  
			  # Step 4: Client Code
			  def process_order(payment_provider, amount):
			      payment_provider.process_payment(amount)
			  
			  # Step 5: Configuration (not shown in this simple example)
			  
			  # Client code using the Provider Pattern
			  if __name__ == "__main__":
			      credit_card_provider = CreditCardPaymentProvider()
			      paypal_provider = PayPalPaymentProvider()
			  
			      process_order(credit_card_provider, 100)  # Process credit card payment
			      process_order(paypal_provider, 50)        # Process PayPal payment
			  ```
		- Simple [[C#]] pseudo-code example
			- ```c#
			  using System;
			  
			  // Step 1: Interface
			  public interface IPaymentProvider
			  {
			      void ProcessPayment(double amount);
			  }
			  
			  // Step 2: Provider Classes
			  public class CreditCardPaymentProvider : IPaymentProvider
			  {
			      public void ProcessPayment(double amount)
			      {
			          // Implement credit card payment logic here
			          Console.WriteLine($"Processing credit card payment of ${amount:F2}");
			      }
			  }
			  
			  public class PayPalPaymentProvider : IPaymentProvider
			  {
			      public void ProcessPayment(double amount)
			      {
			          // Implement PayPal payment logic here
			          Console.WriteLine($"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount:F2}");
			      }
			  }
			  
			  // Step 4: Client Code
			  public class OrderProcessor
			  {
			      public void ProcessOrder(IPaymentProvider paymentProvider, double amount)
			      {
			          paymentProvider.ProcessPayment(amount);
			      }
			  }
			  
			  public class Program
			  {
			      public static void Main(string[] args)
			      {
			          // Client code using the Provider Pattern
			          IPaymentProvider creditCardProvider = new CreditCardPaymentProvider();
			          IPaymentProvider paypalProvider = new PayPalPaymentProvider();
			  
			          OrderProcessor orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();
			  
			          orderProcessor.ProcessOrder(creditCardProvider, 100.0); // Process credit card payment
			          orderProcessor.ProcessOrder(paypalProvider, 50.0);       // Process PayPal payment
			      }
			  }
			  
			  ```

			  package main
			  
			  import "fmt"
			  
			  // Step 1: Interface
			  type PaymentProvider interface {
			  	ProcessPayment(amount float64) error
			  }
			  
			  // Step 2: Provider Classes
			  type CreditCardPaymentProvider struct{}
			  
			  func (c *CreditCardPaymentProvider) ProcessPayment(amount float64) error {
			  	// Implement credit card payment logic here

			  func processOrder(paymentProvider PaymentProvider, amount float64) {

			  	payPalProvider := &PayPalPaymentProvider{}
			  
			  	processOrder(creditCardProvider, 100.0) // Process credit card payment
