# Logs
	- Logs refer to a record of events or messages generated by a computer system, application, or software program. These logs are essential for developers, system administrators, and support teams to understand what's happening within the software, diagnose issues, track system behavior, and troubleshoot problems.
	- ## Typically information contained is Logs
		- **Timestamps**
			- When an event occurred, helping to sequence events and understand the timeline of operations.
		- **Event Descriptions**
			- Details about what happened, including error messages, warnings, or informational messages.
		- **Severity Levels**
			- Indication of the importance or severity of an event (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, critical).
		- **Contextual Data**
			- Additional information related to the event, such as user actions, system state, or environmental variables.
	- Logs can come in various formats, including text files, databases, or structured data formats like JSON or XML. They're generated automatically based on predefined events or based on the instructions developers embed into the code (through logging libraries or built-in logging functions).
	- ## Logging is crucial for
		- **Debugging**
			- When developers need to trace the flow of execution or find the cause of errors in the code.
		- **Monitoring**
			- Keeping an eye on the health and performance of systems in real-time.
		- **Auditing**
			- Tracking user actions or system events for security or compliance purposes.
		- **Analytics**
			- Collecting data for analyzing trends, patterns, and usage statistics.
	- However, managing logs effectively is essential. With large systems generating huge volumes of logs, log aggregation tools, proper filtering, and categorization mechanisms become necessary to make sense of the information.
	- Overall, logs serve as a vital tool for understanding what's happening within software systems, aiding in both proactive maintenance and reactive issue resolution.
