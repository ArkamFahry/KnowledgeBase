- # MicroVM
	- A MicroVM, or Micro Virtual Machine, is a lightweight, isolated environment designed to run a single application or service. Unlike a traditional virtual machine ([[VM]]) which emulate a full hardware stack, including a guest operating system, MicroVMs are optimized for running specific workloads efficiently and securely.
	- ## Key aspects and features of MicroVMs
		- **Minimalistic Design**
			- MicroVMs are designed to be minimalistic, containing only the components necessary to run a specific application or service. They typically include a lightweight kernel, a minimal set of drivers, and the application runtime.
		- **Isolation**
			- Similar to traditional VMs, MicroVMs provide isolation between applications or services running on the same physical hardware. Each MicroVM runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that one MicroVM cannot access the resources of another.
		- **Fast Startup**
			- MicroVMs are designed for fast startup times, allowing them to launch quickly and scale rapidly in response to changes in workload demand. This makes them well-suited for use in cloud computing environments where agility is crucial.
		- **Resource Efficiency**
			- Due to their minimalistic design, MicroVMs consume fewer resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) compared to traditional VMs. This efficiency allows for better resource utilization and cost savings, especially in environments with large-scale deployments.
		- **Security**
			- MicroVMs enhance security by reducing the attack surface. Since they contain only the necessary components to run a specific application, there are fewer potential vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit.
		- **Container-Like Experience**
			- MicroVMs offer a container-like experience, allowing developers to package and deploy applications along with their dependencies in a lightweight, portable format. This simplifies application deployment and management.
		- **Compatibility**
			- MicroVMs are compatible with existing container orchestration platforms, such as [[Kubernetes]], making it easy to integrate them into existing workflows and infrastructure.
	- Overall, MicroVMs provide a balance between the lightweight, fast startup nature of containers and the isolation and security benefits of traditional VMs. They are well-suited for running individual services or applications in a cloud-native environment, offering improved efficiency, scalability, and security.
