# ETL
	- ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It refers to the process of collecting data from various sources, transforming or modifying it as needed, and then loading it into a destination database or data warehouse for analysis, reporting, or other uses.
	- ## ETL steps
		- **Extract**
			- This step involves gathering data from different sources such as databases, spreadsheets, logs, APIs, or any other structured or unstructured data repositories. Data extraction can involve simple copying or querying databases to retrieve specific information.
		- **Transform**
			- Once the data is extracted, it often needs to be cleaned, validated, formatted, and transformed into a suitable structure for analysis or storage. Transformation tasks might include data cleaning (removing duplicates, correcting errors), data validation (ensuring accuracy and completeness), data enrichment (adding missing information), or data aggregation (summarizing or grouping data).
		- **Load**
			- After the data has been extracted and transformed, it is loaded into a target database, data warehouse, or another destination where it can be stored and accessed for analysis, reporting, or other business purposes. Loading involves organizing the transformed data into tables, rows, and columns within the destination system.
	- ETL processes are fundamental in data integration and management, ensuring that data from multiple sources can be effectively consolidated, cleaned, and made ready for analysis or use in business intelligence applications.
