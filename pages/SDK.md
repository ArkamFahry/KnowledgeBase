# SDK: Software Development Kit
	- SDK stands for Software Development Kit. It's a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and code samples that developers use to create software applications for specific platforms, frameworks, or programming languages.
	- SDKs provide a set of tools that make it easier for developers to build applications by abstracting complex functionalities and providing pre-written code modules. They often include [[API]]s (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to interact with and utilize the features of a particular software or platform.
	- For instance, if you're developing a mobile app for iOS, you'd use the iOS SDK provided by Apple. This SDK contains everything you need to create apps specifically for Apple devices, including code libraries, compilers, simulators, and documentation.
	- SDKs can cover a wide range of purposes, from mobile app development to game development, cloud services integration, IoT (Internet of Things) device programming, and much more. They essentially streamline the development process by providing a cohesive set of tools and resources tailored to a specific platform or technology.
