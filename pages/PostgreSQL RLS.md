- # PostgreSQL RLS: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security
	- Row-Level Security (RLS) is a powerful feature in [[PostgreSQL]] that allows database administrators and developers to enforce access controls at the row level within a table. RLS provides a fine-grained security mechanism, enabling different users to have different levels of access to specific rows in a table based on their role or attributes. This ensures that only authorized users can view, modify, or delete certain rows of data, while restricting access to others.
	- ## The key components of Row-Level Security in PostgreSQL are
		- Security Policies
			- RLS is implemented through security policies defined on tables. These policies are rules that determine which rows a particular user can access. A policy specifies a condition or a set of conditions that must be met for a user to be granted access to a row. The conditions can reference attributes in the table or user-specific attributes.
		- Access Control Functions
			- PostgreSQL allows developers to define custom access control functions, which are used to evaluate the conditions specified in the security policies. These functions are executed whenever a user attempts to access or modify data in the table. The access control functions return a Boolean result, determining whether the access should be allowed or denied.
		- Roles and Attributes
			- RLS utilizes PostgreSQL's role-based access control system. Users and groups are assigned roles, and these roles have specific privileges or permissions. The security policies can take into account user-specific attributes or role memberships when determining access to data.
		- Enforcement
			- When a user attempts to perform a query or operation on a table with RLS enabled, the access control function associated with the table's security policy is automatically invoked. The function evaluates the conditions in the policy and either allows or denies the requested operation based on the result.
	- ## Benefits of Row-Level Security in PostgreSQL
		- Fine-Grained Control
			- RLS allows for granular control over data access, providing the ability to restrict access to specific rows of data based on user attributes or roles.
		- Simplified Application Logic
			- With RLS, the access control logic can be embedded directly in the database, reducing the need for complex access control checks in the application code.
		- Data Integrity
			- RLS ensures that sensitive or confidential data remains protected, preventing unauthorized access at the row level and maintaining data integrity.
		- Seamless Integration
			- RLS is seamlessly integrated into PostgreSQL, making it easy to implement and manage security policies without the need for external tools or additional configurations.
	- ## Examples for RLS
		- ### Simple RLS Example
			- A simple example for RLS, with the `users` table included and Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure users can only select their own `todos`
			  id:: 64ca601d-7c00-4dd6-8480-321123b0710b
				- Create the `users` table
					- ```sql
					  CREATE TABLE users (
					  	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
					  	username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
					  	password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
					  );
					  ```
				- Create the `todos` table and add a foreign key constraint referencing the `users` table
					- ```sql
					  CREATE TABLE todos (
					  	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
					  	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
					  	description TEXT,
					  	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) -- Foreign key referencing the `users` table
					  );
					  ```
				- Create a policy function for the `todos` table that checks if the current user has access to a todo
					- ```sql
					  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_user_todo_access()
					    RETURNS BOOLEAN AS
					  $$
					  BEGIN
					    RETURN user_id = current_setting('app.user_id')::INTEGER;
					  END;
					  $$
					  LANGUAGE plpgsql;
					  ```
				- Enable Row-Level Security on the `todos` table and create the SELECT policy
					- ```sql
					  ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
					  
					  CREATE POLICY select_own_todos
					    ON todos
					    FOR SELECT
					    USING (check_user_todo_access());
					  ```
				- Set the `app.user_id` configuration parameter for each user
					- Before any user performs a query on the `todos` table, you need to set the `app.user_id` configuration parameter to the user's ID. This can be done through a client application or by using the `SET` command in PostgreSQL.
				- For example, if the current user's ID is 1
					- ```sql
					  SET app.user_id = 1;
					  ```
			- Now, let's see how RLS works in practice
				- Assume we have the following data in the `users` table
					- | id | username   |
					  |----|------------|
					  | 1  | user1      |
					  | 2  | user2      |
				- And the following data in the `todos` table
					- | id | title         | description     | user_id |
					  |----|---------------|-----------------|---------|
					  | 1  | Todo 1        | Description 1   | 1       |
					  | 2  | Todo 2        | Description 2   | 2       |
					  | 3  | Todo 3        | Description 3   | 1       |
					  | 4  | Todo 4        | Description 4   | 3       |
				- If user 1 executes the following query
					- ```sql
					  SELECT * FROM todos;
					  ```
						- They will only see their own `todos`
							- | id | title         | description     | user_id |
							  |----|---------------|-----------------|---------|
							  | 1  | Todo 1        | Description 1   | 1       |
							  | 3  | Todo 3        | Description 3   | 1       |
				- However, if user 2 executes the same query
					- ```sql
					  SELECT * FROM todos;
					  ```
						- They will only see their own `todos`
							- | id | title         | description     | user_id |
							  |----|---------------|-----------------|---------|
							  | 2  | Todo 2        | Description 2   | 2       |
			- User 2 cannot access the `todos` owned by user 1, and vice versa. RLS ensures that each user can only see and interact with their own `todos`, providing the desired data security and access control.
- RLS is a valuable feature for applications dealing with multi-tenant architectures, where different users or groups need access to specific subsets of data, or in scenarios where data access must be tightly controlled based on various attributes or roles. By leveraging Row-Level Security, PostgreSQL provides an added layer of data protection and control, making it an ideal choice for applications that require advanced security measures at the row level.
