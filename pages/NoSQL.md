# NoSQL: Not Only [[SQL]]
	- NoSQL, often referred to as "Not Only SQL," is a term used to describe a range of database management systems (DBMS) that differ from traditional relational databases (SQL databases). The emergence of NoSQL databases addresses the limitations of SQL databases in handling the massive volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data generated by modern applications.
	- ## Key aspects and characteristics of NoSQL databases
		- **Flexible Data Models**: Unlike relational databases, which use a tabular structure with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a flexible schema. This flexibility allows for the storage and management of various types of data, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, and column-oriented data.
		- **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed for scalability. They can easily handle large volumes of data and distribute it across multiple servers or nodes. This horizontal scaling allows systems to grow efficiently by adding more machines to the database cluster.
		- **High Performance**: Many NoSQL databases are optimized for performance, especially for specific types of queries or data structures. They can handle high throughput and low-latency operations, making them suitable for applications that require real-time data processing.
		- **Eventual Consistency**: Some NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency (known as the CAP theorem). This means that in distributed systems, they might sacrifice immediate consistency in favor of availability or fault tolerance. Also Some of them have tunable consistency like [[Apache Cassandra]] and some of the support [[ACID]] transactions.
	- ## Types of NoSQL Databases
		- **Document-based**: Stores data in documents (like JSON or XML) and provides flexibility in data structures within each document. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.
		- **Key-Value Stores**
			- Store data in a schema-less way using a key-value pair. Examples include [[Redis]] and [[AWS DynamoDB]] .
		- **Column Family Stores**
			- Organize data into columns instead of rows, suitable for analytical workloads. Examples include [[Apache Cassandra]] and [[HBase]].
		- **Graph Databases**
			- Designed for storing and querying graph data, ideal for applications with complex relationships. Examples include [[Neo4j]] and [[AWS Neptune]].
	- ## Use Cases for NoSQL
		- NoSQL databases are often used in applications involving large-scale data storage and real-time analytics, such as social media platforms, IoT (Internet of Things) applications, gaming, and e-commerce.
			- They excel in scenarios where data structure is evolving, and the scale of data is too massive or dynamic for traditional relational databases to handle efficiently.
	- While NoSQL databases offer various advantages, they also come with trade-offs. The lack of a rigid schema can sometimes lead to data inconsistency, and the diversity among NoSQL databases makes it crucial to choose the right type that aligns with specific application requirements.
	- Remember, the "Not Only SQL" approach implies that NoSQL isn't a direct replacement for SQL databases but rather a complementary tool that serves specific use cases where SQL databases might fall short.
