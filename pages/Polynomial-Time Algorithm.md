- # Polynomial-Time Algorithm
	- A polynomial-time algorithm is an algorithm whose running time is upper-bounded by a polynomial function in the size of the input. This means that the running time of the algorithm is proportional to some power of the size of the input, where the exponent is a constant.
	- ## Polynomial-Time Algorithm are efficient
		- Polynomial-time algorithms are considered to be efficient, while exponential-time algorithms are considered inefficient because the execution times of the latter grow much more rapidly as the problem size increases.
	- ## Some Polynomial-Time Algorithm
		- The selection sort sorting algorithm on n integers performs $$O(n^2)$$ operations. Thus it runs in time $$O(n^2)$$ and is a polynomial-time algorithm.
		- All the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison) can be done in polynomial time.
		- Maximum matchings in graphs can be found in polynomial time.
