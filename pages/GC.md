# GC
	- GC stands for Garbage Collection, a fundamental concept in computer science, especially in programming languages that manage memory automatically, like [[C#]], [[Python]], and [[JavaScript]], among others.
	- In simple terms, when a program runs, it dynamically allocates memory for variables, objects, or data structures. However, the program might stop using some of that memory at certain points, leaving it as "garbage" or unreachable data. If this garbage accumulates without being cleared, it can lead to memory leaks, where the program consumes more and more memory until it crashes or slows down significantly.
	- Garbage Collection refers to the automatic process where the programming language's runtime system or a specific component called the garbage collector identifies and deletes this unused memory, freeing up resources for future use. It helps manage memory efficiently and prevents memory leaks by reclaiming memory that is no longer needed by the program.
	- Different garbage collection algorithms exist, each with its own approach to identifying and reclaiming garbage. Some common strategies include reference counting, mark-and-sweep, generational garbage collection, and more, each with its advantages and trade-offs in terms of efficiency and overhead.
	- Overall, Garbage Collection significantly simplifies memory management for developers, allowing them to focus more on writing code and less on manual memory allocation and deallocation.
