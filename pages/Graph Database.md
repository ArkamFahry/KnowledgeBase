- # Graph Database
	- Graph databases are a type of database that use graph structures for data storage. They're designed to represent and store data in terms of entities (nodes) and the relationships (edges) between them.
	- ## Concepts In a graph database
		- Nodes represent entities like people, places, things, or concepts.
		- Edges represent the relationships or connections between these entities.
	- These databases are highly useful for scenarios where relationships between data points are as important as the data itself. They excel in handling complex relationships and are often used in social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, network analysis, and many other domains where understanding connections is crucial.
	- Advantages of Graph databases like
		- **Relationships as First-Class Citizens**
			- Relationships are as important as the data they connect, enabling easier querying and analysis of connected data.
		- **Flexibility and Scalability**
			- They can adapt well to evolving schemas and easily accommodate changes in data structures.
		- **Efficient Queries for Connected Data**
			- Traversing relationships in graph databases is typically faster and more efficient than in traditional relational databases for certain types of queries, especially those involving complex connections.
	- Popular graph databases include [[Neo4j]] , [[Amazon Neptune]], and [[Azure Cosmos DB]]. They're chosen based on the specific requirements of the application, scalability needs, and integration capabilities with other systems.
