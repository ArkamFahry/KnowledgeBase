- # Linked Lists
	- A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data.
	- There are many types of linked lists
		- [[Linked List]] (Singly Linked List)
			- Nodes contain data and a pointer to the next node.
			- Unidirectional traversal.
		- Doubly Linked List
			- Nodes have references to both next and previous nodes.
			- Allows bidirectional traversal.
		- Circular Linked List
			- Forms a loop; last node points to the first (or the previous node of the first in doubly circular lists).
		- Sorted Linked List
			- Nodes arranged in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).
		- Hash Linked List
			- Used in hash table implementations to handle collisions.
			- Each hash index contains a linked list.
		- XOR Linked List
			- Employs XOR of addresses of adjacent nodes for memory efficiency.
			- Pointer contains the XOR of previous and next node addresses.
