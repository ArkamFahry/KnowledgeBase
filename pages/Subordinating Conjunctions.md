- ## What are Subordinating Conjunctions
	- A subordinating conjunction is a word or phrase that links a dependent clause to an independent clause. This word or phrase indicates that a clause has informative value to add to the sentence’s main idea, signaling a cause-and-effect relationship or a shift in time and place between the two clauses.
- ## Let's break it down
	- A dependent clause, also known as a subordinate clause, is a clause with two specific qualities. Firstly, it does not express a complete unit of thought on its own; it cannot stand as its own sentence. Secondly, it *depends* upon an independent clause—one that can stand on its own as a complete sentence—to form a complete idea. If independent and dependent clauses could be likened to Batman and Robin, the dependent, or *subordinate,* clause would be Robin, Batman’s assistant. The independent, main clause would be Batman, his superhero boss.
- ## Subordinating Conjunctions showing cause and effect
	- The subordinating conjunction that is simplest to explain is *because*. *Because* is a conjunction with just one purpose: to show a cause-and-effect relationship between a subordinate clause and a main clause. On its own, a clause beginning with *because* is incomplete.
		- Example: Because he wouldn’t wear a seat belt.
			- The sense that there is something missing here. Let’s add an independent clause so this statement has something to lean on.
		- Example: Robin wasn’t allowed in the Batmobile any longer.
			- Now we will combine the two in a complex sentence.
		- Example: Robin wasn’t allowed in the Batmobile any longer because he wouldn’t wear a seat belt.
			- Now we can see that this sentence makes sense
			- In this sentence, “Robin wasn’t allowed in the Batmobile any longer” is an independent clause. It could stand on its own as a complete sentence. A clause that shows a causal relationship, such as “because he wouldn’t wear a seat belt” (answering the question “Why?” or “For what purpose?”), is often referred to as a *clause of purpose*.
		- Other subordinating conjunctions that can show cause-and-effect relationships and function in the same way are **for, as, since, though, due to, provided that, because of, unless, **and **so/so that**
			- Example: Batman required strict compliance with seat belt rules, hence Robin was not allowed to ride in the Batmobile.
			- Example: Since Robin refused to wear his seat belt, Batman has banned him from the Batmobile.
- ## Subordinating Conjunctions signaling relationships of time or place
	- Another function of subordinating conjunctions is to show a relationship between two clauses involving a transition of time or place. Some examples of such subordinating conjunctions are **once, while, when, whenever, where, wherever, before,** and **after**.
		- Example: Once Batman learned that Robin had not been wearing his seat belt, he took away his keys to the Batmobile.
		- Example: Robin looked regretfully at the Batmobile whenever he passed it in the Batcave.
		- Example: After Batman was done working for the night, Robin took a secret ride in the Batmobile.
		- Example: Before Robin gets his job in the Batcave back, he must promise to stop playing with the Batmobile.
- ## Comma placement and Subordinating Conjunctions
	- Subordinating conjunctions that fall in the middle of a sentence are generally not preceded by a comma. This is the opposite of what is done with coordinating conjunctions, or words that join two independent clauses (**for, and, nor, but, or, yet,** and sometimes **so**).
	- When a subordinate clause begins a sentence, however, the whole clause (but not the subordinating conjunction itself) is followed by a comma.
		- Example:
			- Incorrect Whenever, Batman was away, Robin drove the Batmobile.
			  background-color:: red
			- Correct: Whenever Batman was away, Robin drove the Batmobile.
			  background-color:: green
		- Example:
			- Incorrect: Robin drove the Batmobile, whenever Batman was away.
			  background-color:: red
			- Correct: Robin drove the Batmobile whenever Batman was away.
			  background-color:: green
