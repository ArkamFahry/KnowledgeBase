- # Realtime Database
	- Realtime Database is a [[Database]] system that is designed to handle and process data in real-time or near real-time. Unlike traditional databases that focus on storing and retrieving data, real-time databases emphasize low latency and high availability to provide instant access to data as it is updated or created. These databases are often used in applications where immediate data access and responsiveness are critical, such as in real-time analytics, financial trading systems, online gaming, and messaging applications.
	- ## Features typically supported by Realtime Databases
		- **Streaming data processing**
			- They can process data as it arrives, allowing for real-time analysis and decision-making.
		- **Change Data Capture ([[CDC]])**
			- They capture and record changes to data as they occur, enabling applications to react to these changes in real-time.
		- **Event-driven architecture**
			- They use events to trigger actions or updates in response to changes in the database, ensuring that applications stay synchronized with the latest data.
		- **Low latency**
			- They minimize the time between data updates and the availability of that data to applications, ensuring that users receive up-to-date information quickly.
		- **High availability**
			- They are designed to be highly available, ensuring that data is accessible even in the event of hardware or network failures.
	- Real-time databases can be implemented using various technologies and approaches, including in-memory databases, streaming data platforms, and specialized databases designed for real-time processing.
