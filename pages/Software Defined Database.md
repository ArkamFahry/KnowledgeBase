- # Software Defined Database
	- Software Defined Database, like [[Convex]], is a database system where the database's behavior, features, and rules are defined and implemented using code, typically in the same programming language as the rest of the application. This approach contrasts with traditional databases where features are provided by the database engine itself and are typically configured through declarative languages or SQL.
	- ## Features of a Software Defined Database
		- **Database behavior is defined by code**
			- Instead of relying on built-in features of the database engine, developers write code to define how the database should behave. This includes defining table structures, access controls, validation rules, and other aspects of database functionality.
		- **Flexibility and extensibility**
			- Since database behavior is defined by code, developers have more flexibility to customize and extend the database to meet their specific needs. They can easily add new features, modify existing ones, or integrate the database with other parts of the application.
		- **Integration with application code**
			- Because the database behavior is defined using the same programming language as the application, it can be tightly integrated with the application code. This makes it easier to maintain consistency between the database and the application and simplifies development and debugging.
		- **Easier deployment and management**
			- Software-defined databases can be deployed and managed using the same tools and processes as the rest of the application. This can simplify deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the database.
	- Overall, software-defined databases offer a more flexible and customizable approach to database development, allowing developers to build databases that are closely aligned with the needs of their applications.
