# V8 Isolate
	- V8 Isolates are a part of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the engine that powers Google Chrome and some other Chromium-based browsers. An isolate in V8 represents a separate instance of the JavaScript engine. Each isolate has its own heap memory space where it allocates and manages memory for JavaScript objects and code execution. Isolates are used to create separate JavaScript environments, allowing for better isolation and security between different instances of JavaScript code running within the same application. This isolation helps prevent interference and conflicts between different parts of a program or between different applications running on the same platform.
