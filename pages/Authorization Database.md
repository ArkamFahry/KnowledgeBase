- # Authorization Database
	- An Authorization Database is a centralized repository or system that stores and manages information related to user access permissions within a computer network, application, or system. Its primary purpose is to control and regulate access to resources based on predefined rules and policies.
	- In the context of computer security and access control, the Authorization Database works in conjunction with an Authentication system. While authentication verifies the identity of users, authorization determines the actions or resources that authenticated users are allowed to access.
