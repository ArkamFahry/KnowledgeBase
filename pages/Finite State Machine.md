# Finite State Machine
	- A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to design and describe the behavior of systems that can exist in a finite number of states at any given time. These states are typically represented by nodes, and transitions between states are triggered by specific events or input signals.
	- ## Components of a Finite State Machine
		- **States**
			- The distinct conditions or situations that a system can be in. These are represented by nodes in the FSM diagram.
		- **Transitions**
			- The paths or edges between states, indicating the change from one state to another. Transitions are triggered by events or input signals.
		- **Events or Input Signals**
			- External stimuli or triggers that cause the system to transition from one state to another. These events can be things like user inputs, sensor readings, or any other relevant signals.
		- **Actions**
			- The activities or behaviors associated with entering or exiting a particular state. Actions are often performed in response to an event or during a state transition.
	- ## Finite State Machines can be classified into two main types
		- **Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFSM)**
			- In a deterministic FSM, for a given state and input, there is a unique next state. The transition between states is predictable and unambiguous.
		- **Nondeterministic Finite State Machine (NFSM)**
			- In a nondeterministic FSM, there can be multiple possible next states for a given state and input. The system may choose any of these possible transitions based on certain conditions.
	- FSMs are widely used in various applications, including digital circuit design, control systems, communication protocols, and software engineering. They provide a structured way to model and analyze the behavior of systems with discrete states and transitions.
