	- WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format designed as a portable compilation target for high-level languages on the web. It's an open standard developed by a consortium of tech companies including Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, among others. WASM aims to enable high-performance applications to run in web browsers while maintaining compatibility across different platforms and architectures.
	- WASM enables high-performance execution of code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust, allowing them to run securely and efficiently on the web. WASM provides near-native performance, portability across platforms, and seamless integration with existing web technologies, making it a powerful tool for running complex applications in the browser environment.
