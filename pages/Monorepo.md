# Monorepo
	- A monorepo, short for "monolithic repository," is a version-control system where multiple projects, or parts of a project, are stored within a single repository. Instead of having separate repositories for different components or services, all code and related resources are centralized in one place.
	- In a monorepo setup, you might have folders or directories representing different projects, libraries, applications, or services within the same repository. This approach allows developers to manage and version control all related code and assets together.
	- # advantages of a Monorepo
		- **Code Sharing and Reusability**
			- Developers can easily share code across different projects within the monorepo. This promotes code reuse and helps maintain consistency across various parts of the software.
		- **Atomic Commits and Versioning**
			- Changes across multiple projects can be committed and versioned together, ensuring that interdependent changes are synchronized and compatible.
		- **Simplified Dependency Management**
			- Managing dependencies becomes more straightforward as components within the monorepo can reference each other directly, eliminating versioning issues and ensuring compatibility.
		- **Easier Refactoring and Collaboration**
			- Developers have visibility into the entire codebase, making it easier to refactor, collaborate across teams, and perform global codebase-wide changes.
	- However, managing a monorepo can become challenging as the codebase grows larger. It might require robust tooling and workflows like to efficiently build, test, and deploy changes. Also, conflicts may arise when multiple teams or developers work on different parts of the monorepo simultaneously.
	- Many large tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have adopted monorepos to manage their extensive codebases efficiently. Yet, the decision to use a monorepo or a multi-repository approach depends on the specific needs, scale, and complexity of a project.
