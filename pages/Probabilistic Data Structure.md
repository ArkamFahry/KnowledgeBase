# Probabilistic Data Structure
	- A probabilistic data structure is a data structure that uses probabilistic techniques to provide approximate answers or trade accuracy for efficiency. Unlike traditional data structures that aim for exact results, probabilistic data structures are designed to handle large datasets or streaming data where exact answers are impractical or too costly to compute.
	- ## Key characteristics of probabilistic data structures
		- **Approximate Results**
			- Probabilistic data structures provide approximate answers with controlled error rates. This means that the result returned by the data structure may not be exact, but it is within a certain error margin.
		- **Efficiency**
			- Probabilistic data structures are designed to be efficient in terms of time and space complexity. They often use techniques like hashing, sampling, or randomization to achieve this efficiency.
		- **Trade-offs**
			- By providing approximate results, probabilistic data structures trade accuracy for efficiency. This trade-off is often acceptable in applications where exact answers are not critical.
		- **Applications**
			- Probabilistic data structures are commonly used in areas such as data streaming, network algorithms, databases, and distributed systems. They are particularly useful for tasks like approximate counting, membership testing, and cardinality estimation.
		- **Error Analysis**
			- Probabilistic data structures come with guarantees about their error rates. For example, a data structure may guarantee a false positive rate in membership testing or an error bound in cardinality estimation.
	- Examples of probabilistic data structures include [[Bloom Filter]]s, [[Cuckoo Filter]]s, [[Count-Min Sketch]]es, [[HyperLogLog]], and [[Skip List]]s. These data structures are widely used in practice due to their efficiency and ability to handle large datasets with reasonable accuracy.
