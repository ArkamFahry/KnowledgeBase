- # PostgreSQL Functions
	- PostgreSQL functions are named blocks of code that perform a specific task or a set of tasks. They allow you to encapsulate a series of SQL statements into a single, reusable unit. Functions can take parameters, return values, and can be used to simplify complex queries, enhance code modularity, and improve overall code organization.
		- ## There are two main types of functions in PostgreSQL
			- **User-Defined Functions**
				- These are functions created by users to perform custom operations.
				- User-defined functions can be written in various languages, including SQL, PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, PL/Python, etc.
				- They can take input parameters and return a value.
				- User-defined functions are stored in the database and can be called from SQL queries, making them useful for modularizing code and reducing redundancy.
				- Example of a simple user-defined function in PL/pgSQL
					- ```sql
					  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_numbers(a INT, b INT)
					  RETURNS INT AS
					  $$
					  BEGIN
					  RETURN a + b;
					  END;
					  $$
					  LANGUAGE plpgsql;
					  ```
					- ```sql
					  SELECT add_numbers(5, 3); -- Returns 8
					  ```
			- **Built-in Functions**
				- PostgreSQL provides a wide range of built-in functions that perform common tasks. These functions are part of the database system and can be used without explicitly defining them.
				- Built-in functions cover various areas such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, date and time functions, aggregate functions, and more.
				- Example of using a built-in function
					- ```sql
					  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table; -- Returns the number of rows in 'my_table'
					  ```
					- In addition to these, PostgreSQL also supports aggregate functions, window functions, and procedural languages like PL/pgSQL for more complex logic in functions.
					- Functions play a crucial role in database development by promoting code reusability, improving code maintainability, and enabling the creation of complex applications with a modular structure.
