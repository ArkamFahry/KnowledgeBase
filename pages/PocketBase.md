	- ## PocketBase
		- PocketBase is the little brother to [[Supabase]] which is the open source alternative to [[Firebase]].
		- PocketBase is a [[BaaS]] written in [[Go]] but this is an odd one rather than running in several services its a single [[Go/Binary]] which has an embedded [[SQLite]] database running in WAL mode. Putting the database directly next to the Binary gives a performance gain in data fetching speed while sacrificing [[Horizontal Scalability]]. However, this is not a problem as PocketBase can handle 10,000 concurrent connections. So this will be more than enough for most projects.
	- ## PocketBase Features
		- Admin Dashboard
			- PocketBase has a killer admin dashboard which  helps to manage all aspects of the PocketBase instance with a developer friendly UI.
		- Database
			- The king of the hill is the [[SQLite]] database which is the backbone of the system and it has a phenomenal admin UI to manage all accepts of the database.
			- The database also has good to have features like relations, native [[JSON]] support and also array relationships.
			- The database also runs on WAL mode to increase performance making it blazingly fast.
			- ### View collections
				- **View collection** is a read-only collection type where the data is populated from a plain [[SQL]] `SELECT` statement, allowing users to perform aggregations or any other custom queries in general.
				- This makes it easy to get an aggregate view of the data without weird client-side hacks.
		- Authentication
			- There is built in email and password auth and Single Sign-On auth with token management.
			- There are also built-in verification email for signup flow.
			- Password Forgot flow is also built-in with email verification.
			- The auth user model can be customized to have extra fields like user roles and other information which is not common in [[BaaS]] providers.
		- Authorization
			- PocketBase has built in Authorization powered by a auth rules which are written for API endpoints these auth rules are push down based this means they are compiled into SQL when a request happens making the auth rules performant and giving access to the data in a granular fashion.
		- API generation
			- The PocketBase server has the ability to generate ready-to-use crud apis for the tables created.
			- These APIs have built-in Authorization making them a breeze to work with.
			- The APIs don't strictly follow rest standards so they have the ability to expand on database relations and embed that in the response to create a more concise data payload like [[GraphQL]] making it a joy to work with.
		- Real-time
			- PocketBase has [[SSE]] based real-time making it so clients can subscribe to data changes in the database. This can be collection level changes or single record level changes. The use of [[SSE]] means all of this is stateless making it easier than [[WebSockets]]
			- The Authorization rules defined for the Viewing of data are also inherited by the real-time system making it secure by default.
		- File storage
			- The system implements two file storage systems file-based file storage making use of the system file system or a [[AWS S3]] and S3 compatible object storage file system connecting to an S3 compatible server.
			- The files also have references stored to them in the database making sure there are no orphan files.
			- The files also get Authorization rules that can be defined making them secure by default.
		- SQL generation
			- Every API request is compiled to a [[SQL]] query using PocketBase/dbx making the resolution of every single request as efficient as possible. The auth rules are also compiled to [[SQL]] using the same technic which makes request resolution extremely efficient.
		- SDKs
			- There are two SDKs
				- JavaScript
				- Dart
			- These SDKs rap the PocketBase API giving a great developer experience.
		- Extensibility
			- The Go binary can be used as a framework and can be extended with extra features.
	- ## PocketBase Problems
		- No foreign keys
			- The relations and resolved on the application level so there are no foreign keys in the database making it hard to migrate away from. There can be some consistency issues.
			- This is done to support array relationships.
			- But joins are done at the database level using JSON functions so there is no performance penalty.
		- Scaling issues
			- Because it is tightly coupled the only way is [[Vertical Scalability]].
		- Real-time
			- Cannot scale
				- The real-time system is coupled as an inbuilt event system making it almost impossible scale.
			- Detect external data modification to the database
				- The system fires [[SSE]] events for API request not database changes so this could be an issue in the long run.
			- Doesn't guarantee Event delivery
				- Sometimes a data change event can be lost.
			- Doesn't guarantee Event delivery order
				- The events will be delivered not in the order that they happened.
