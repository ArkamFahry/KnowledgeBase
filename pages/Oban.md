# Oban: Robust job processing for Elixir
	- ![oban.png](../assets/oban_1702105408254_0.png)
	- Oban's primary goals areÂ **reliability**,Â **consistency**Â andÂ **observability**.
	- Oban is a powerful and flexible library that can handle a wide range of background job use cases, and it is well-suited for systems of any size. It provides a simple and consistent API for scheduling and performing jobs, and it is built to be fault-tolerant and easy to monitor.
	- Oban is fundamentally different from other background job processing tools becauseÂ *it retains job data for historic metrics and inspection*. You can leave your application running indefinitely without worrying about jobs being lost or orphaned due to crashes.
