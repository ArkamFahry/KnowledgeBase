- # Count-Min Sketch
	- Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure used for estimating frequencies of elements in a data stream. It trades accuracy for efficiency, allowing for approximate counts of elements with limited space usage.
		- ## How Count-Min Sketch works
			- **Initialization**
				- Start with a two-dimensional array of counters, typically represented as \( \text{counters}[i][j] \), where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( d \) and \( j \) ranges from 1 to \( w \). \( d \) is the number of hash functions and \( w \) is the number of counters per hash function.
			- **Hash Functions**
				- Use \( d \) different hash functions to hash each element in the data stream. These hash functions should be independent and uniformly distribute elements across the counters.
			- **Increment Counters**
				- For each element in the data stream, increment the counters corresponding to the hashed indices from each hash function.
			- **Estimating Frequency**
				- To estimate the frequency of an element, hash it with each of the \( d \) hash functions to get \( d \) indices.
				- Return the minimum value among the counters at these \( d \) indices. This minimum value provides an estimate of the frequency of the element in the data stream.
			- **Error Bound**
				- The Count-Min Sketch guarantees that the estimated frequency is within \( \epsilon \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i \) of the true frequency with a probability of \( 1 - \delta \), where \( \epsilon \) and \( \delta \) are parameters that control the error probability, and \( f_i \) is the true frequency of the \( i \)th element in the stream.
			- **Applications**
				- Count-Min Sketch is used in various applications where approximate counting is acceptable, such as network traffic monitoring, frequency estimation in data streams, and approximate querying in databases.
			- **Trade-offs**
				- Count-Min Sketch provides approximate counts with a small error probability, making it suitable for scenarios where memory efficiency is important.
				- However, it may overestimate or underestimate frequencies due to collisions in the hash functions, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and memory usage.
	- In summary, Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure that efficiently estimates frequencies of elements in a data stream with controlled error rates. It is useful in scenarios where accurate counting is not critical, but memory efficiency and speed are important.
