- Building listener based event trigger system on a [[Database]]. Rather than database level triggers these are triggers which listen to database changes from the application level. The trigger are created in the application and the app registers an event listener worker to the database event which pushes the changes into the application with at least once delivery guaranty. This means applications can react to database changes without polling the database for changes.
