- Found out building a [[CDC]] package for [[PostgreSQL]] is a hard task so had to build a package which can be used as a base for building more complex systems.
	- Currently a simple package [pgstream](https://github.com/ArkamFahry/pgstream) has been completed.
		- The package is capable of building reading the replication log.
		- It is also capable of snapshotting to bring in old data from the table.
		- The package is also capable of checkpointing keep replication state in case of failure or restarts and it can resume from previously left of position.
		- The package also has filtering powered by [apache arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/).
