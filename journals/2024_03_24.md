- [[Redis]] has dropped it's open source license for a proprietary source available license making so it's time to switch to an alternative like [[KeyDB]] or [[NATS KV]] which can be suitable replacements for [[Redis]]. Also the licensing change mostly effects Redis as a service providers like and not self hosted users. This affect will not be a big issue for Redis as a service providers because most of them run custom built memory storage engines with Redis compatible API on top. Most likely the last open source version of Redis will be forked and maintained by the community which will be the best outcome.
