- Got started on building a [[PostgreSQL]] based object storage abstraction which can simplify the use of S3.
	- The system can split a single S3 bucket into multiple logical ones.
	- It can track pre-signed uploads using background jobs.
	- The system is easy to deploy the only required external dependencies are [[Amazon S3]] compatible object store and a [[PostgreSQL]] database.
