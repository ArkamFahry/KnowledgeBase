- DONE Find out how to do bulk deletion of S3 objects by S3 object key path prefix.
	- Bulk deletions are only possible by listing the files by prefix and the deleting them on by on using something like jobs or workflows to do them correctly and fault tolerantly.
	- A better approach is to store the object metadata in a database like [[PostgreSQL]] and then use it as source of truth for these type of operations without doing a full listing of objects is expensive.
- Best way to structure a application is module based approach rather than types if we separate logic in modular way it mush easy to handle than using a single type based system.
