- Find a way to use updated hash handle writes on a database. Every entity in the DB would have a updated hash which will be used to calculate if a object has changed then perform the update. If the hash is not changed don't update the object in DB. By using this technique we can reduce DB writes significantly.
- Also note when creating DB fields use preform checks for `""` empty strings. Because differentiating between `null` and `""` is a pain so don't do empty string inserts.
