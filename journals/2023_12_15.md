- Change the approach of learning into just in time learning. Make the move start working on a project on the way learn the things needed for that project. Which is better than trying to learn everything at once.
- DONE Find out why [[Rust]] is much better for app development and if it's worth the time and effort. Yes it's worth the effort.
	- Yes it's better the error handling is best in class.
	- No null reference error.
	- It's not as hard as every one says.
	- Functional programing paradigm is a breathe of fresh air.
	- Good for understanding CS concepts.
	- Result type is magic. Result error handling is better than exception.
	- [[WASM]] support is best in class.
	- Can run in parallelly with other languages to give native performance to other languages.
	- Can achieve [[C]]/ [[C + +]] level performance without the memory footgun issues.
- DONE Find out if to check if something exists in DB before insert or let the DB throw an error.
	- Found out let the DB throw error and handle it better for performance. A select would do a table or index scan to find if exists. so if we do a 1 million writes there would be on million selects. So it's better let DB throw an error and handle the error gracefully.
