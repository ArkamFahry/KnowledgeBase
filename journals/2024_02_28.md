- [[PGStream]] will be incremental snapshotting according to [Netflix DBLog](https://netflixtechblog.com/dblog-a-generic-change-data-capture-framework-69351fb9099b) implementation to make snapshotting fast, incremental, non-blocking with the ability to pause and resume snapshotting any point in time and  ability to run snapshot operations on demand.
- [[PGStream]] requirements.
	- Snapshotting and Incremental Snapshotting of tables in parallel.
	- On demand Incremental Snapshotting.
	- Pausing and Resuming Incremental Snapshotting.
	- Reading the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] using [[CDC]].
	- Publishing all events into [[NATS]].
	- Ability to Explicitly include and exclude tables.
	- Ability to have persistent or transient [[NATS]] stream.
	- Automatically map table changes to [[NATS]] Streams formatted according to `[database].[schema].[table]`. Also ability to override the naming scheme and ability to give custom names.
	- [[PGStream]] instance should be able to handle multiple [[PostgreSQL]] database instances.
	- Should be able to add or remove databases, schemas and tables to [[PGStream]] without restarts.
	- Include a schema specific to [[PGStream]] called `pgwarp` in this will have signaling tables so while creating a table in database we could add a record to signaling table to tell to setup a stream for the table or tell to snapshot a existing table. So we could grantee the atomic creation or removal of a stream directly from [[PostgreSQL]].
