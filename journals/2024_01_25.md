- Found a library which implements SQL transactions in [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) [[Go]] using [[Go Context]] using [pgxatomic](https://github.com/ysomad/pgxatomic) which puts the transaction into the [[Go Context]].
	- Putting the transaction in the [[Go Context]] is making the context heavy and also limits the transaction time. There is considerable 12% - 15% performance decrease in all the queries in the system.
	- Went through to much pain trying to hide the transactions but found out it's to hard to do so rather than putting it to context we should use aggregate root pattern or just use the transactions in the service layer.
	- Also if needed rather than using full transactions we can build a optimistic concurrency by using version which will be more work on server side but it will be faster and more scalable.
