- Building reliable systems means keeping it simple and clean also found out building unnecessary level of abstractions don't help in building focused software.
- Also when building a system build a MVP quick as possible and then iterate on it. It's better to make some thing that is ready to use than building some thing perfect. If it works we can iterate upon it.
- Also find out a another thing don't try to hide database transactions under a repository abstractions it's hard to do and to much of a hassle. Also cross repository transactions are bad to solve this map a single aggregate to a repository rather than a single table or collection to the repo.
- Lesson learned auth service should keep track all changes to application state from start to finish so. There should be audit log for all the operations. A better way to do this is rather keeping a audit log is to use [[Event Sourcing]] to keep track of all changes in a immutable way this means the system has a history of all operations without a audit log. Also it's faster, scalable and fault tolerant when using [[Event Sourcing]].
