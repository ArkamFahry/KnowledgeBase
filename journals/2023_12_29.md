- Get a understanding of how [[Temporal]] supports multiple databases with a single interface in a pluggable DB architecture.
	- They use a general store interface with domain based data model then the domain model is mapped to the DB in the store layer so the service layer doesn't know anything about how a model is persisted. This abstraction gives flexibility to support multiple databases.
	- Also note temporal uses DB's which which have tabular formats like [[SQLite]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], [[Apache Cassandra]] and [[ScyllaDB]]. So without using foreign keys we can model data tabular way and support multiple tabular DB's.
	- According to most articles reliably supporting multiple DB's with consistency is hard. [[Temporal]] is a workflow executor so it's more reliable than most software. So this means it's viable to support multiple DB's without downside.
