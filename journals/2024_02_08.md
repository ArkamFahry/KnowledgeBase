- Found out building a monolithic system on simple technology is easy to work with and maintain.
- Building reliable [[Webhooks]] is a hard task found out the hard way if the [[Webhooks]] need to be reliable it would be good to use a transactional database like [[PostgreSQL]] or a workflow engine like [[Temporal]] to implement the [[Webhooks]] system.
	- If the [[Webhooks]] are queued and run transactionally with retries there will be minimum inconsistencies in webhooks service.
	- Retries would be easy if the system is transactional because we can transactionally get the webhook try to send it. If it fails we can mark it as failed in the same transaction and mark it for later retry without much hassle.
	- Also running [[Webhooks]] service with a transactional database means we don't need handle large number consistency edge cases. Which makes it more reliable than a non transactional system while making it easy to develop.
