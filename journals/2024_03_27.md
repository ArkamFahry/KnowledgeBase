- TODO Find out methods to build a transparent caching which runs in front of [[PostgreSQL]].
	- Using a proxy based cache where we will proxy `select` statements through the caching server then cache the records. Then if a `update` or `delete` statement is sent through the proxy we check it against the cache and invalidate the records which have been modified or removed. This is fairly easy to implement but there is an issue if a record is modified in [[PostgreSQL]] directly without using the cache proxy the cache will no be invalidated but there is a solution for this issue we can tap into the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] at the same time to invalidate the cache using [[CDC]].
