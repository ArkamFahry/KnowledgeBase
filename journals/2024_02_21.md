- Used [[Conduit]] for [[CDC]] and ran tests on it. it is reliable on sending [[CDC]] events from [[PostgreSQL]] to [[Redpanda]] was able to push around a million events without any data loss with minimum resource usage.
- Also found out running [[Debezium]] on a hosted service like [upstash](upstash.com) is easy to deploy and there is no maintains at all so using [[Debezium]] is also a valid choice.
- Also started building some custom connectors for [[Conduit]] to push [[PostgreSQL]] [[CDC]] events to [[Meilisearch]] and [[Typesense]] for full text indexing.
