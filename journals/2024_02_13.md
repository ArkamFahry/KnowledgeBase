- DONE Find a way to implement uniqueness in [[Event Sourcing]].
	- **Include uniqueness info in events**
		- Make sure each event (like "user registered" or "product sold") carries information that helps maintain uniqueness, like user IDs or product codes.
	- **Keep track of uniqueness in projections**
		- Create a side view of your data (called a projection) that checks for uniqueness based on the events. For example, if you're tracking users, keep a list of registered email addresses to ensure no duplicates.
	- **Check for uniqueness before saving events**
		- Before saving new events, check if they would violate any uniqueness rules. If they do, don't save them.
	- **Prevent duplicates**
		- Set up your system so that if the same event is received twice (due to network issues, for example), it doesn't cause duplicates in your data.
	- **Handle conflicts gracefully**
		- If there's a conflict (like two users trying to register with the same email at the same time), have a plan for how to resolve it without breaking your uniqueness rules.
	- **Deal with errors well**
		- Make sure your system can handle errors gracefully, like informing users when they're trying to do something that would break uniqueness rules.
	- **Fix mistakes**
		- If something goes wrong and uniqueness rules are violated, have a way to go back and fix the mistake, like by undoing the action that caused it.
	- In essence, uniqueness in event-sourced systems boils down to ensuring that each event carries enough information to maintain uniqueness, checking for conflicts before they happen, and handling any conflicts or mistakes that do occur in a way that keeps your data consistent.
