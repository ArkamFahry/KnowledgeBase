- File path search in application level using database is slow find a alternative solution.
	- Simple solution is to index the file in a search engine.
	- Hard solution write a crazy [[PostgreSQL Functions]] to search the path in DB level.
		- Went with the hard way to stay away from third party depencencies.
			- Table Defenition
				- ```sql
				  do
				  $$
				      begin
				          if not exists (select 1
				                         from pg_catalog.pg_type
				                         where typname = 'object_upload_status') then
				              create type storage.object_upload_status as enum ('pending', 'in_progress', 'complete', 'failed');
				          end if;
				      end
				  $$;
				  
				  create table if not exists storage.objects
				  (
				      id               text                                           not null check ( storage.text_non_empty_trimmed_text(id) ),

				      name             text                                           not null check ( storage.text_non_empty_trimmed_text(name) ),
				      path_tokens      text[]                                         not null generated always as (string_to_array(name, '/')) stored,
				      mime_type        text                                           not null check ( storage.text_non_empty_trimmed_text(mime_type) ),
				      size             bigint                                         not null check ( size > 0 ),
				      is_public        boolean                      default false     not null,

				      upload_status    storage.object_upload_status default 'pending' not null,
				      last_accessed_at timestamptz                                    null,
				      created_at       timestamptz                  default now()     not null,
				      updated_at       timestamptz                                    null,

			- Search Function
				- ```sql
				  
				  create or replace function storage.object_search(bucket_name text, path_prefix text, limits int default 100,
				                                                   levels int default 1, offsets int default 0)

				                  bucket           text,
				                  mime_type        text,

				      language plpgsql

				  $$
				  begin
				      return query
				          with files_folders as (select path_tokens[levels] as folder
				                                 from storage.objects

				  end
				  $$;

			- Process
				- First take the name and turn it into a tokenized path with generated column splitting the values into and array then get the array with a depth and search the name with a like query which can get slow so find a way to optimize it.
			- Optimization
				- Swap out the array for ltree for hierarchical data.
				- Replace the like query with a `tsvector` or `pg_bm25` and `pg_sparse`
