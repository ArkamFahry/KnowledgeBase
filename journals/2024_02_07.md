- Work on installing [[PostgreSQL]] with [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) plugin to get [[WAL]] log as [[JSON]].
	- Found out it's a pain to setup [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) in [[PostgreSQL]] we have to run a custom image so i have chosen to use (supabase/postgres)[https://github.com/supabase/postgres] it already has [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) built into it so no longer required to install or maintain a plugin.
- Found out depending on [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) is a bad thing because many platforms don't support [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json)  so i have planed to use the raw [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]] log for processing changes using [pgstream](https://github.com/ArkamFahry/pgstream) so it doesn't depend on any hard to install external [[PostgreSQL Extensions]].
