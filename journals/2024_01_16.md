- Find out a good project structure to build [[Go]] applications.
	- Finding it out the hard way it's more like create your own adventure story and most of the time on project structure that others give will not work so its better to start with simple flat files and build a project structure which works will building.
- Get the requirements for a storage service
	- Upload files
		- Direct upload
		- Pre-signed URL upload
	- Track upload sessions
	- Keep track of upload metadata
	- Do searches on the file path using metadata preferably push the search directly to DB for better search capability.
		- Search capability should be use file traversal from parent to child with infinite depth.
		- Use the primary database for search it self maybe use extension like `pg_bm25` or `pg_tsvec` with a custom file search function written into the database.
		- Keep the system external dependency free.
	- Also the system has to keep a consistent state from upload start to upload completion or failure with atomic consistency.
		- So the jobs for checking for upload status would be run on [[PostgreSQL]] in a transactional way to keep everything consistent and reliable.
