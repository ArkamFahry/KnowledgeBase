- Wrote a [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]] log reader but keeping the log reading consistent on failures are hard. Simulated some failures and got issues with log message loss. Found out keeping the [[WAL]] reading reliable for [[CDC]] is a extremely hard task. Thinking of not re inventing the wheel and just using tried and true [[Debezium]]. Tried to use [[Debezium]] but deployment and running of [[Debezium]] is hard and resource expensive. It's better to use a technique like polling or using a custom [[WAL]] reader.
