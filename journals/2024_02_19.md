- Wrote a [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]] log reader but keeping the log reading consistent on failures are hard. Simulated some failures and got issues with log message loss. Found out keeping the [[WAL]] reading reliable for [[CDC]] is a extremely hard task. Thinking of not re inventing the wheel and just using tried and true [[Debezium]]. Tried to use [[Debezium]] but deployment and running of [[Debezium]] is hard and resource expensive. It's better to use a technique like polling or using a custom [[WAL]] reader.
- Came to a conclusion rather than using [[Debezium]] or trying to build a custom solution. We will be using [[Conduit]] which has [[CDC]] and it also has pluggable connectors and a simple extensible architecture. Because of it's pluggable [[GRPC]] based connector interface we can build our own connectors. [[Conduit]] is simple light weight single [[Go]] binary so it would be easy to deploy and maintain the only required external dependency is a [[PostgreSQL]] for metadata storage.
