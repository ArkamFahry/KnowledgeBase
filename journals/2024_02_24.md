- Built a [[Transactional Outbox Pattern]] side car service to pick up messages from [[PostgreSQL]] table and publishes it to [[NATS]] with at least once delivery guarantees. The service simply polls [[PostgreSQL]] and pushes them out to [[NATS]]. This can optimize it by using [[PostgreSQL LISTEN and NOTIFY]] the events table can say to the service to start polling with a notify message when a events is inserted then the service starts polling if message count low the service could slow down polling if no messages exists the service stop polling but periodically checks for unpublished events in this state service can be woken up again by using notify event on insert to the outbox table.
