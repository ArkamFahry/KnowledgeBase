- Found out that we can do direct inserts into [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]] without writing into a table.
	- [[PostgreSQL]] query to write arbitrary message to [[WAL]] with `pg_logical_emit_message()`
	- ```sql
	  select pg_logical_emit_message(
	  	true,
	    'events',
	    '{
	    		"id": "0e42dc10-f9d9-491b-9079-6159e128eefb",
	    		"aggregate_type": "user",
	    		"aggregate_id": "event_user",
	    		"type": "user.created",
	    		"payload": {
	      		"id": "user_65636174-fbb6-474d-b50e-232a8254bf60",
	      		"name": "test_user",
	      		"email": "user@gmail.com",
	      		"roles": [
	        			"user",
	        			"admin"
	      		]
	    		}
	  	}'
	  );
	  ```
		- Rather than writing into any table this will be directly written to the [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]]. This can be used by a [[CDC]] engine like [[Debezium]] to implement sync events to other systems without double write inconsistency problems.
	- Running [[Debezium]] for a small scale systems was a pain with it's size resource usage and maintenance. So we have chosen to bite the bullet and write our own [[CDC]] engnie for [[PostgreSQL]].
		- Requirements for the [[PostgreSQL]] [[CDC]] engine.
			- Only support [[PostgreSQL]] as [[CDC]] source.
			- Need to be a library and can be used as a single binary no runtime dependencies preferably written in [[Go]] or [[Rust]] for preformance.
			- Need have snapshotting to load historical data.
				- The snapshotting shouldn't lock the tables.
