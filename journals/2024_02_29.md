- [[PgStream]] implementation for multiple [[PostgreSQL]] instance support in a single instance of [[PgStream]].
	- [[PgStream]] would have to register a [[PostgreSQL]] connection on the fly and configure them to be listen to.
	- [[PgStream]] also needs to be able activate isolated streams for tables adjacent to the primary stream. While keeping the primary stream a new stream can spin up on demand to backfill a service or build a service from previous state or just give a clean stream. This means the incremental snapshot operation won't effect the primary stream.
	- [[PgStream]] implementation should take inspiration from [[DBLog]] to implement non blocking incremental snapshots with some extras like selective incremental snapshots per table or a list of tables.
