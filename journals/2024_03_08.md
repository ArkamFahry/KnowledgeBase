- A [[FaaS]] system which is integrated with a [[Realtime Database]]. Then there can be functions which are reactive to database changes and pushes updates through [[WebSockets]] or [[SSE]] to the invoker. This functions should also generate a ready to use client which can also handle reactive real-time data stream. A system like this will be a [[BaaS]] with more control over all the logic because everything is a function the user can chose how to implement the function logic giving more flexibility than existing [[BaaS]] systems.
