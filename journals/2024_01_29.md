- DONE Find out how to document [[Events]] in a event driven system.
	- using [asyncapi](https://www.asyncapi.com/) [[API]] docs or [buf](https://buf.build/) protobufs can be used to document events in a strongly type way.
- [[Events]] should have first class schemas to keep events consistent between multiple service and also event models should be generated from the schema the specification should be the source of truth.
- Also when structuring a project structure it into modules according to features and not types this makes the project easier to understand and cleaner.
