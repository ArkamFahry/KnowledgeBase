- Build a data plane powered by multiple databases with specific capabilities to run applications smooth without much of issues.
	- Requirements of the data plane.
		- Need to be powered by [[PostgreSQL]] as primary data store no [[PostgreSQL]] flavors just pure and distributed [[PostgreSQL]] powered by [[pgEdge]] and extra features and optimizations added by [[Tembo]].
		- Need to replicate [[PostgreSQL]] tables into [[Search Database]] like [[Meilisearch]] or [[Typesense]] to give fuzzy text capabilities. Do the replication from [[PostgreSQL]] using the [[WAL]] and [[WAL-Listener]] to keep in consistent and push them through [[NATS]] for back pressure and to recover in case of failure.
