- Build a data plane powered by multiple databases with specific capabilities to run applications smooth without much of issues.
	- Requirements of the data plane.
		- Need to be powered by [[PostgreSQL]] as primary data store no [[PostgreSQL]] flavors just pure and distributed [[PostgreSQL]] powered by [[pgEdge]] and extra features and optimizations added by [[Tembo]].
		- Need to replicate [[PostgreSQL]] tables into [[Search Database]] like [[Meilisearch]] or [[Typesense]] to give fuzzy text capabilities. Do the replication from [[PostgreSQL]] using the [[WAL]] and [[WAL-Listener]] to keep in consistent and push them through [[NATS]] for back pressure and to recover in case of failure.
		- Also the system should publish events for all data changes in [[PostgreSQL]] to [[NATS]] using [[WAL]] and [[WAL-Listener]] and these table change events can be consumed by any other service or internally without directly querying the DB and keeping the system decoupled.
		- The System should also have seamless integrations for file uploads to [[Amazon S3]] or any S3 compatible service while storing the metadata on [[PostgreSQL]]. The storage [[API]] should be easier to use rather than direct S3 [[API]]. It also needs to support resumable file uploads with [[Tus]].
		- Automated caching needs to be built to [[PostgreSQL]] using [[ReadySet]] so data flows can be used to keep a really fast cache constantly updated without extra cache invalidation problems. Other caching needs will be handled by [[Redis]].
		- Ability to send [[Webhook]] for [[PostgreSQL]] database events which are published into [[NATS]] using [[WAL-Listener]].
