- [uber schemaless datastore triggers](https://www.uber.com/en-LK/blog/schemaless-part-three-datastore-triggers/) which is one of the best implementation of usable database event triggers for a database system. Rather than these triggers being internal database triggers these can be used by external applications to listen to DB data changes which eliminates the requirement of building a custom events system. All of these triggers support at least once delivery making them scalable, fault-tolerant, and lossless. Also making the database the central source of truth means there will be less data redundancy and inconsistencies.
