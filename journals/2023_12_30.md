- Start building a storage abstraction for [[AWS S3]] and other S3 compatible storage engine like ([[Backblaze B2]], [[Cloudflare R2]], [[DigitalOcean Spaces]], [[Akamai Object Storage]], [[Vultr Object Storage]], [[Wasabi]] and [[Minio]] etc.)
	- Requirements of the system.
		- Support any [[AWS S3]] compatible object storage provider.
		- Store object metadata in a database easy object search and retrieval.
		- Acknowledgement on upload complete should be sent from server side and not depend on client to give the acknowledgement. Preferably employee [[Webhooks]] to send acknowledgement.
		- Make the server backend API first. This means server employees API's with API key auth to be use by a backend service not directly by the frontend. If possible build direct from frontend upload support in the future.
		- Use direct [[AWS S3 Pre-Signed-URL]] uploads to not use band with on the server side.
		- Build client [[SDK]]'s to work in the frontend and backend.
