- Note for myself to get good at building software write a lot of software to get good. In software, quantity creates quality with time
	- Write a lot of code. write 💩💩💩 code. Then see the 💩💩💩 code and reflect on it. Then learn to make it better
		- Then learn design patterns
		- Then learn clean code
	- Practice doesn't make perfect it's more like  `Practice makes permanent`
	- Also, the rule of 👍 build stuff in secrecy don't talk about what you do let your work do the talking.
