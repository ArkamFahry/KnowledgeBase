- Event hooks into [[PostgreSQL]] `insert`, `update` and `delete` events. The event hook system will be a worker server which listens to [[PostgreSQL]] events. The client register a worker telling the worker server to listens for the changes for the specific table event by listening to the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] the event is then persisted to [[NATS]] then pushed out from the worker to the subscribed client with at least once delivery. Applications react to [[PostgreSQL]] events with this system. This works as external triggers which can be used by applications to react to [[PostgreSQL]] events without polling [[PostgreSQL]]. The system is extremally efficient because rather than querying [[PostgreSQL]] we listen to the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] can be listened to without any hindrance performance because it is used for low latency replication of [[PostgreSQL]] data so there is no performance overhead.
