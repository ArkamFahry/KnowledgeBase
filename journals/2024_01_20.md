- Found out there is [[Raft]] based [[Cron Job]] with [[Dkron]].
- ORM are inherently good when working and quick and easy projects but they are hard to scale if using ORM see how it optimized primarily check if it runs native joins.
- When doing events with [[PostgreSQL]] and outbox pattern its rather easy to read the [[WAL]] log than doing a poll based query system. Found out polling can put huge amounts of pressure on DB even with micro batch based operations when the amount of events are large.
