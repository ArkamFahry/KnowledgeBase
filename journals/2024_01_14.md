- When putting [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]] level to `logical` for real-time listeners remember to make it so to auto drop replication slot or [[WAL]] will overflow eating up disk space.
- Find out how to create a a [[PostgreSQL Functions]] for setting the updated at trigger
	- ```sql
	  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION util.set_updated_at()
	  RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
	  BEGIN
	      new.updated_at = now();
	      RETURN new;
	  END;
	  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
	  
	  
	  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_table_updated_at
	  BEFORE UPDATE ON schema.table
	  FOR EACH ROW
	  EXECUTE FUNCTION util.set_updated_at();
	  ```
- Found a way to create [[PostgreSQL Functions]] to create easy journaling ability for tables using
	- [GitHub - flowcommerce/lib-postgresql: Libraries support psql for play](https://github.com/flowcommerce/lib-postgresql)
- Find a way to handle concurrent update without pessimistic locks because when doing file uploads keeping a lock for a long time would be bad for the database.
	- Possible solution do optimistic locks by adding version number or timestamp to the entity then before update check if the current version is equal to the version in DB if the DB version has changed we rollback the operation and then we do retry rather than holding locks for a long time.
	- Using a more simple solution is to build the application state as workflows using something like [[Temporal]] which have all these issues solved out of the box.
