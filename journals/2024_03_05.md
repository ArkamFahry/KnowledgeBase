- Found out a [[OCC]] based system with automatic retries is faster than a [[PCC]] based system in most cases. Also [[PCC]] based systems have issues like if the lock holder crashes the system can go into a deadlock or the lock can be held for a long time. But [[OCC]] has some disadvantages in highly concurrent system with large number conflicting operations but these can be solved using [[DOCC]]. A [[DOCC]] based system can be faster and more concurrent than most [[PCC]] based systems.
