- Found out building a indexing pipeline from [[PostgreSQL]] to [[Typesense]] or [[Meilisearch]] is hard task. Using [[CDC]] we could replicate data with consistency but the at least once delivery semantics can push the same record many times in 
   a row so deduplication should be handled or consumer should be idempotent. Also indexing denormalized multi table aggregates as single documents are hard because events are only fired per table so we have to find a way to compute and combine results on the fly. In the meantime change delta detections for multi table aggregates are mush harder than single table change detections we should also solve this in a efficient and preferment way.
