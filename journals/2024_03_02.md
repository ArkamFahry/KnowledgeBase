- Coolest thing is a [[Software Defined Database]] like [[Convex]]. Database which uses the same application language to implement features which a required for the application rather than depending completely on the the database engine. Which gives more control over the database interaction rather than making the database implementation a black box. System like [[Convex]] is more capable than a normal database system because it's programmability.
