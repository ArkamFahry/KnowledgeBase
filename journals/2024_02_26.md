- Found out changing [[Debezium]] config during runtime is hard and signaling tables can only be used for configure snapshotting. also [[Debezium]] server ships with a lot of not required connectors. Our only requirements are [[PostgreSQL]] to [[NATS]] event publishing and pushing [[PostgreSQL]] historical snapshots incrementally to while reading the [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]]. Also one the run we should be able to add or remove tables from the [[CDC]] event stream and we should be able to do on demand snapshots and incremental snapshots of tables on the fly if needed.
