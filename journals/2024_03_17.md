- Build a bridge extension for [[PostgreSQL]] to push events to [[NATS]] directly from the database. Also push the events transactionally to [[NATS]] form [[PostgreSQL]]. This would create a transactional event system which bridges the gap between [[PostgreSQL]] and [[NATS]].
- [[Elixir]] and [[Beam]] are considered a superpower duo due to their unrivaled ability to handle massive concurrency and fault tolerance. Beam, with its lightweight processes and built-in mechanisms for fault tolerance, has been powering highly reliable telecom systems for decades. Elixir, built on top of Beam machine, inherits these strengths while adding modern features like metaprogramming and a more readable syntax. Together, they offer a robust platform for building distributed, fault-tolerant, and highly concurrent applications, making them a superpower in the world of scalable and reliable systems.
