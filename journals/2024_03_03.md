- Building a [[Software Defined Database]] on top of [[TiKV]] which looks like cool concept. We can use the [[TiKV]] storage engine which means we have a rock solid foundation.

A [[Software Defined Database]] would give unparallel flexibility and reliability over any existing database system. We could call it less of a database stateful application framework.
