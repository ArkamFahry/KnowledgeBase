- Building a [[Software Defined Database]] on top of [[TiKV]] which looks like cool concept. We can use the [[TiKV]] storage engine which means we have a rock solid foundation. The we can build extra features on top of it. We can also use [[PostgreSQL]] as the underlying storage engine for building a [[Software Defined Database]]. A [[Software Defined Database]] would give unparallel flexibility and reliability over any existing database system. We could call it less of a database stateful application framework.
- Features of the perfect database.
	- Support for schema less, partial schemas and full schema support.
	- On the fly schema gen the database introspects and smartly detects what data is in a table and generates a schema.
	- Make the database reactive meaning any query to the database should be able to be turned into a subscription query which returns data in a realtime.
	- The complete database should be [[ACID]] compliant.
	- Support full-text search and vector-search natively.
