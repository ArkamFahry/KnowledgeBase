- Building a [[Software Defined Database]] on top of [[TiKV]] which looks like cool concept. We can use the [[TiKV]] storage engine which means we have a rock solid foundation. The we can build extra features on top of it. We can also use [[PostgreSQL]] as the underlying storage engine for building a [[Software Defined Database]]. A [[Software Defined Database]] would give unparallel flexibility and reliability over any existing database system. We could call it less of a database stateful application framework.
- Features of the perfect database.
	- Database should support schema less, partial schemas and full schema support.
	- Database should generate schema on the fly by smartly introspecting and detecting what data is in a table and generates a schema.
	- Database should be reactive meaning any query to the database should be able to be turned into a subscription query which returns data in real-time.
	- Database should be [[ACID]] compliant.
	- Database should support full-text search and vector search natively.
	- Database should support for running delayed database mutations and queries.
	- Database should generate fully type safe clients for any language.
	- Database should support for [[DOCC]] to operate without database locks.
	- Database should have native soft deletes.
	- Database should support native versioning of data to track all changes.
	- Database should support native object storage.
	- Database support running serverless functions literally in the database right next to the data making the functions fast as possible. Ability to run [[WASM]] modules directly in the database. Also use the database guarantees to execute code as workflows. Give these actions the ability to react to database changes. Add the ability to run functions on database events reacting to database changes. Add ability to have auto retries with exponential backoff  on functions without extra config.
