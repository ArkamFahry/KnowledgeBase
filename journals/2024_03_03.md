- Building a [[Software Defined Database]] on top of [[TiKV]] which looks like cool concept. We can use the [[TiKV]] storage engine which means we have a rock solid foundation. The we can build extra features on top of it. We can also use [[PostgreSQL]] as the underlying storage engine for building a [[Software Defined Database]]. A [[Software Defined Database]] would give unparallel flexibility and reliability over any existing database system. We could call it less of a database stateful application framework.
- Features of the perfect database.
	- Support for schema less, partial schemas and full schema support.
	- On the fly schema gen the database introspects and smartly detects what data is in a table and generates a schema.
	- Make the database reactive meaning any query to the database should be able to be turned into a subscription query which returns data in a realtime.
	- The complete database should be [[ACID]] compliant.
	- Support full-text search and vector search natively.
	- Support for running delayed database mutations and queries.
	- Generate fully type safe clients for any language.
	- Support for [[PCC]] and
	- Support running serverless functions literally in the database right next to the data making the functions fast as possible. Ability to run [[WASM]] modules directly in the database. Also use the database guarantees to execute code as workflows. Give these actions the ability to react to database changes. Add the ability to run functions on database events reacting to database changes. Add ability to have auto retries with exponential backoff  on functions without extra config.
