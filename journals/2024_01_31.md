- TODO For today try to use existing go libraries to build a [[Finite State Machine]] powered [[Raft]] based simple [[KV Database]] in [[Go]].
	- Tech used to build the system.
		- [[KV Database]] will be [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger)
		- [[Raft]] library will be [hasicorp-raft](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft)
		- Web Server [gofiber](https://gofiber.io/)
	- Implemented a simple [[Raft]] system using existing packages
		- [simple_raft](https://github.com/ArkamFahry/simple_raft)
	- In the future planning to re-write it from scratch without using any packages.
