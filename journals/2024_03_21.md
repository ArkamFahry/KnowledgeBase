- How to Implement a trigger system for [[PostgreSQL]] which can be used by external applications.
	- [[PostgreSQL]] will be the database node which will be running in `wal_level=logical`.
	- [[PgTrigger]] will be the trigger service node. The service will subscribe to the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] and continuously listen to database changes. The client would subscribe to the trigger service which will spins up a worker per client and will send the data changes for the requested table to the client via [[GRPC]], [[WebSockets]] or [[Webhooks]].
	- This trigger system will give applications ability to react in real-time to database changes without polling the database. This will be a great developer productivity improvement.
