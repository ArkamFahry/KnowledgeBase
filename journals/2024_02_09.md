- Look into light weight [[CDC]] systems.
	- Came across [conduit](https://conduit.io/) a opensource data integration service which can implement [[CDC]] and has a easy to work UI and configuration. It's purely written in [[Go]] making it an easy to deploy binary it also has limitless extensibility with plugins. Building a plugins to [[Conduit]] it easy with the conduit [[SDK]]. Also the only third party dependency it needs in production is a single [[PostgreSQL]].
	- [[Conduit]] has great performance using [[Goroutine]].
- Came to conclusion though [[Conduit]] is easy to use it's not stable as [[Debezium]] for now so it will [[Debezium]].
