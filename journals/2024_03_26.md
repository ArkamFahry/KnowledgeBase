- Find a suitable function runtime to build upon to create smart function runtime with reactive real-time function support. The runtime candidate will be [[Fission]], [[OpenFunction]], [[Firecracker]] or [[Open Runtimes]]. The most suitable way to implement this smart runtime is to take a relatively low level runtime and building on it which will make the implementation easier than try to hack together a high level runtime.
