- [[DriftBase]] a proof of concept system system which is a [[BaaS]] which put's a [[FaaS]] system as the front and center of all operations. Without giving a rigid data API or rigid authorization system we can build a [[FaaS]] system which has direct interaction with Database, Object Storage, Authentication, Authorization and Realtime then the Function interface would generate a client SDK to be used by the client. The functions can also be Realtime reactive functions which can be subscribed to making it easy to sync server state to the client. This type of system would be better than most [[BaaS]] system because the flexibility to implementing logic like a custom system while having the conveniences of a [[BaaS]].
- Leveraging [[NATS]], we can implement scalable [[WebSockets]] architecture. NATS Streaming provides persistent message storage and delivery, ensuring that messages are reliably delivered even if subscribers are temporarily offline. For real-time communication, NATS core messaging offers low-latency pub/sub capabilities, allowing us to efficiently broadcast messages to multiple subscribers. By combining these two components, we can create a robust and scalable WebSocket solution that meets the demands of modern web applications.
