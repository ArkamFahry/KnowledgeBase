- DONE Fork the workflow engine [go-workflows](https://github.com/cschleiden/go-workflows).
	- Implement a [[PostgreSQL]] based backend for [go-workflows](https://github.com/cschleiden/go-workflows).
- DONE Plan on build a side car service to read outbox events and publish it to [[Apache Kafka]], [[NATS]] or [[RabbitMQ]].
	- The service will be written in [[Go]] and will be packaged as a single binary.
	- It will primarily support [[PostgreSQL]] as the database.
	- The service will use pooling strategy with micro batching to read events and publish them to a [[Message Broker]]. Also research on the use of [[PostgreSQL LISTEN and NOTIFY]] to implement a heartbeat and pull in events with signal. If possible try to get the [[PostgreSQL]] [[WAL]] to work with the service then we can using push as the first strategy then fallback to polling this way the service will be faster and less resource intensive.
	- Try to keep it light weight as possible with no external dependencies.
