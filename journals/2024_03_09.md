- Find a way to efficiently do data diffs of update operations received for [[PostgreSQL WAL]] to [[PGWarp]]. The updated data is formatted as `before`, `after` and `diff`. The `diff` used to pin point which values specifically changed so downstream services can find out the changed values without fully parsing the `before` and `after` values. The `diff` detection should be quick and efficient because large number of values can be updated in a small time frame so the system should detect the `diff` without slowing down the processing speed.
