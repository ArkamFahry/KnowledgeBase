- DONE Write a Note on [[NATS]] with the topic [[NATS: A Powerful and Overlooked Dev Tool]].
- Using [[NATS]] as a request and response based event fabric to implement communication between services. Rather than using [[GRPC]] or [[HTTP]] to do communication we could use [[NATS]] to implement inter process communication.
- [[PGStream]] will support [[NATS]] request response based communication so the client could directly send a message through [[NATS]] to [[PGStream]] to create a new event stream. This means [[PGStream]] will have pre defined streams and also will be capable of creating a new stream on demand when requested by the client. The ability to define streams on the fly makes [[PGStream]] flexible to use.
