- DONE Find out how to fault-tolerantly use the [[PostgreSQL WAL]] to implement [[CDC]] with Snapshots.
	- Setup [[PostgreSQL]] with `wal_level=logical` to get logical replication started.
	- Start a replication slot to listen to the [[PostgreSQL WAL]].
	- Implement a WAL receiver for [[PostgreSQL]] and listen to the WAL log.
	- Each time after WAL receiver reads the WAL log send a checkpoint single of WAL SLN checkpoint to [[PostgreSQL]] to return the next set of WAL logs.
	- Also the service should persistently store the WAL checkpoint service side incase if the service fails and we need to resume from the previously received WAL point.
	- The service should use the native [[PostgreSQL]] `pgoutput` replication format for wide compatibility.
	- The WAL events should be processed by a WAL processor and will be sent to specific [[NATS Subject]]'s and it should be subject per table with the subject format of `[database].[schema].[table].[operation]` making it easy to filter on subjects.
	- Service should be able to fault-tolerantly Snapshot or Incrementally-Snapshot table data which are not present in the WAL log to create a full stream of data from the table. The Snapshots should be able to run on demand to build a stream with full state of the table.
