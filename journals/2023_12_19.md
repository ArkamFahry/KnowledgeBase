- Find the best way model an eventual consistent file storage system which would store files in [[AWS S3]] or any S3 compatible storage. I will not be able to use native [[AWS S3 Event Notifications]] because all S3 compatible providers don't Implement the native event system. So the upload tracking will need to be handled by using a transactional queue system. Which will use the queue to set the upload state and at the end of the upload to find if the upload failed or not and commit it to the database.
