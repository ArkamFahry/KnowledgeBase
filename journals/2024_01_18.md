- DONE write a set of postgresql libs to track all change histories for tables and store them in a record history table.
	- Created a [[PostgreSQL]] data model to track table changes in a audit schema
		- [postgresql audit utils](https://github.com/ArkamFahry/postgres-libs/tree/main/audit)
	- Limitations
		- if large amounts of writes are happening performance can degrade in these cases use a dedicated extension like [PGAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) to do auditing for large high through put tables.
	- Find a way to cleanly implement transactional jobs to process file uploads without failure.
