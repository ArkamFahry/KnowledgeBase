- Find a way to build a job queuing library which can handle [[PostgreSQL]].
	- Found [[River]], [[Oban]], [[Graphile Worker]] and [[pg-boss]].
- We came to the conclusion only external dependency required is [[PostgreSQL]] it can full fil all the requirements while being the most reliable system.
- Went through [[InvaliDB]] paper a very rare white paper on how to build a fast push based DB on top of pull based databases feels like building this on top of [[PostgreSQL]] will be a useful feature turning good old [[PostgreSQL]] into realtime database.
