- [[PGStream]] will be a simple service which can listen to [[PostgreSQL]] changes using [[CDC]] and it will also support incremental snapshotting of data and building event persistent event streams which will be can be use to re construct state from a later point in time. It will publish these event streams into [[NATS]]. The system support incremental snapshotting which means it doesn't lock the table also incremental snapshotting and [[CDC]] run in parallel making it efficient this means snapshot data and [[CDC]] event data are returned as a single stream of data.
