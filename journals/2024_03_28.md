- Checked out [[KeyDB]] a multi-threaded faster version of [[Redis]] which is completely open-source. [[KeyDB]] has some issues but in most cases [[KeyDB]] is faster and easier to deploy than [[Redis]]. [[KeyDB]] is superior [[Redis]] in performance, replication and clustering while being fully open source so [[KeyDB]] is good replacement for the now closed sourced [[Redis]].
