- Checked out [[KeyDB]] a multi-threaded faster version of [[Redis]] which is completely open-source. [[KeyDB]] has some issues but in most cases it is faster and easier to deploy than [[Redis]]. [[KeyDB]] is superior to [[Redis]] in performance, replication and clustering while being fully [[Open Source]] so it is good replacement for the now [Closed Sourced Redis](https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/).
