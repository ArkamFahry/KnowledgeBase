- Implementing events in a event driven systems and publishing events without distributed transactions.
	- Do the creation or mutation of domain entity and publish the event in to `events` table in the same DB transaction.
	- Then read the events table with and publish the events asynchronously to a queue using background workers.
	- Then read the events from the queue in the consumer and put it into local database a process it in micro batches. Implement idempotency because the same event can be published twice in case of failure or some inconsistency.
- TODO find a way to index relational data from [[PostgreSQL]] in [[Meilisearch]] or [[Typesense]] reliably.
