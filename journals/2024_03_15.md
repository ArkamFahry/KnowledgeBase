- New type of [[BaaS]]. Current [[BaaS]] systems have are to rigid and not flexible. We could build a totally different system rather than having auto generated API's will have all the things like database, auth, storage and real-time but we will expose these to a smart reactive function runtime the developer can write the functions which will also support real-time reactivity and the function runtime will also generate a client SDK which can be used these SDK's will be type-safe and reactive. The SDK can be used by the client's like a normal [[BaaS]]. The programmable nature and being function first will give the ability to pick and chose on how to implement logic and what technologies to use for the functions this also means most of the logic will be encapsulated in the functions making the system reliable, maintainable, flexible, fast and secure than current [[BaaS]] systems. This new type of [[BaaS]] would use normal programming language to implement logic no weird proprietary config language or crazy SQL based logic it will be just be code making it more understandable, reliable, maintainable, flexible, fast, secure and portable making this a better choice than current [[BaaS]] systems.
