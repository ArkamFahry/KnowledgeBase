- TODO Find a resilient way to delete object form S3 provider and DB in sync without inconsistencies between the two storage.
	- One of the approaches is to use [[S3 Event Notifications]] to inform about file upload statuses but these are only supported in [[Amazon S3]] and [[Minio]] other providers don't support event notification.
	- Second way is to use a workflow engine like [[Temporal]] to check if the object is uploaded by pooling the object storage service with a HEAD request see if upload is completed.
	- Third way is to use a background job system like [[Oban]] or [[River]] to check if upload is completed by doing a head request.
