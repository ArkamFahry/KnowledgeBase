- Smart [[FaaS]] with reactive functions support. Traditional [[FaaS]] request/response based system rather than using request/response system the client would would hold a stateful WS connection to the function runtime and the functions will be invoked through this connection while also using the connection to subscribe to reactive functions which can push data to the client in real-time. This function runtime will generate a SDK for all the function endpoints these SDK's can directly be used by the client. The SDK will support native real-time so the SDK will give the client to be real-time without any extra effort.
