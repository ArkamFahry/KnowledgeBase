- Found out how to run a fast cache on [[PostgreSQL]] using [[PostgreSQL Unlogged Table]]. Which doesn't have a [[WAL]] it means the table is fast but will lose data in case of failure.
- How to build a simple cache on [[PostgreSQL]] with [[PostgreSQL Unlogged Table]].
	- Create table `cache` as unlogged table
		- ```sql
		  CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE cache (
		      id serial PRIMARY KEY,
		      key text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
		      value jsonb,
		      inserted_at timestamp
		  );
		  
		  CREATE INDEX index_cache_key ON cache (key);
		  ```
			- Only difference from normal table is the `UNLOGGED` keyword. As for the columns, here we use `JSONB` values, but you could use whatever suits your needs, e.g. `text`, `varchar` or `hstore`. We also include `inserted_at` column, which will be used for cache invalidation. Optionally, we also create an index for better read performance.
		- Simple that's it fast cache on [[PostgreSQL]] maybe also increase shared buffers to keep more data in memory. This disk based cache is larger compared to in-memory system though our reads will be slower we will have more cache space this means less cache misses. Also we could use DB triggers to invalidate the cache if needed or use [[PostgreSQL LISTEN and NOTIFY]] to invalidate the cache or use the [[WAL]] to bust the cache.
