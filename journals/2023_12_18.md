- [[GraphQL]] is query language for services don't try to map your DB to graphql.
- When using [[REST]] [[API]] always use plural form for entity collections.
- Don't ever use [[UUID's]] for a resource.
	- First of all they are hard to copy paste format them to not have `-` so it's easier to copy paste.
	- Also add a prefix to the uuid like if it's a user resource `user_{uuid}`. This makes it more understandable when used in the context of resource.
	- Also don't use uuids it's better to use [[ULID's]], [[KSUID's]] or [[Snowflake ID's]] which are sortable and most databases like sorted data and this can improve read and write performance  drastically.
