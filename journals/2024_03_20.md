- DONE Find out how to implement a [[PostgreSQL WAL]] receiver of [[CDC]].
	- **Enable Logical Replication**: Set `wal_level` to `logical` in the PostgreSQL configuration (`postgresql.conf`) and restart PostgreSQL.
	- **Create Publication**: Use the `CREATE PUBLICATION` SQL command to define a publication for the tables you want to capture changes from.
	- **Create Subscription**: Use the `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` SQL command to create a subscription that defines the connection and options for the CDC consumer.
	- **Start Subscription**: Begin the subscription to start receiving changes from the publisher. The changes will be delivered as a stream of WAL events.
	- **Receive Changes**: Implement a WAL receiver that connects to the publisher and receives the WAL stream. Use a library like `libpq` for C or `pgx` for Go to handle the connection.
	- **Decode WAL Events**: Decode the received WAL events using a library.
	- **Apply Changes**: Apply the decoded events from the publisher to the service.
	- **Checkpointing**: Add checkpoints after processing the decoded WAL to find out What was the last processed point and use checkpoints to recover from failures.
	- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage any issues that may arise during the CDC process, such as network failures or data conflicts.
	- **Monitoring**: Monitor the CDC process to ensure it is keeping up with the changes on the publisher side and to detect any issues early.
	- **Shutdown Gracefully**: Use the `DROP SUBSCRIPTION` command to stop the subscription and clean up any resources used by the CDC process.
