- Found out abstracting away DB transactions a hard and unwieldly so it would be better to run it in the service layer.
- Went through a lot of code and found out transactions cannot be hidden from the service layer because they are dependent on shared state which is hard to be shared between repositories so it can be a hard thing to make it work.
