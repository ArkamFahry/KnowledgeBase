- Tried out [[REST]] or [[GraphQL]] [[API]] generation on top of [[PostgreSQL]] and came to the conclusion using a [[AST]] to compile request into [[SQL]] using database schema inference will make the queries faster than most commonly hand written queries.
	- There are few tools which can generate [[API]]'s on top of [[PostgreSQL]] like [[PostgREST]], [[Hasura]] and [[pREST]] which can generate efficient [[SQL]] queries according to DB schema.
