- Tried out [[REST]] or [[GraphQL]] [[API]] generation on top of [[PostgreSQL]] and came to the conclusion using a [[AST]] to compile request into [[SQL]] using database schema inference will make the queries faster than most commonly hand written queries.
	- There are few tools which can generate [[API]]'s on top of [[PostgreSQL]] like [[PostgREST]], [[Hasura]] and [[pREST]] which can generate efficient [[SQL]] queries according to DB schema.
- Running transactional system powered by a database like good old [[PostgreSQL]] is always better than any eventually consistent system.
- Also queuing jobs on [[PostgreSQL]] using [[River]], [[Oban]] or [[Graphile Worker]] are fault tolerant than any external job queue.
- Also when running long term blocking jobs it's better to use a workflow executor like [[Temporal]] which has more reliable execution than any hand rolled systems.
