- Got into the idea of building native [[PostgreSQL]] extensions with [pgrx](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx) to index [[PostgreSQL]] data to [[Meilisearch]] or [[Typesense]]. Also use a extension to natively create a publications into event system like [[NATS]] or [[Redpanda]] no extra dependencies this can make [[PostgreSQL]] central source of truth.
- Idea use [[PostgreSQL]] extension written using [pgrx](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx) to implement native event publishing for operations in a [[PostgreSQL]] table by using custom triggers. The extension would use [[NATS]] and it will hook into to table insert, update and delete operations then push those changes to [[NATS]].
