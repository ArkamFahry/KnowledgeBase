- Building generic backends shouldn't directly interact with the client but most of them should be used with a backend service with API key auth and shouldn't be exposed to the frontend.
- If auth is going to be used and API is directly interacted from the frontend we will need use a DB with push down auth like [[PostgreSQL/RLS]] or [[SurrealDB/Permissions]] so the system would be easy to manage or we could use a expression engine like [[Expr]] to evaluate auth rules given the some auth data then we can return a true or false depending on the expression evaluation to give access to the system.
- Things to do when building Software
	- Always try to test much as possible.
	- Always keep feature creep away from projects.
	- Start quick build quick like a hackathon and then after completion iterate.
	- Always write good documentation.
	- Don't shy away from using Google, ChatGPT and other AI tools. They can be a big help for some edge case problem we will bang our head against the wall.
	- Don't re-invent the wheel if a good tool is there use it.
	- Always use the write tool for the job and also don't use to much complex tools. It's a two sided blade.
	- Always don't build auth use a third party. The people who build auth know about it better than us so trust them and use a auth provider. building auth is a risky endeavor.
