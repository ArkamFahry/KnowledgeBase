- Found out [[Debezium]] interacts with [[PostgreSQL]] using full database level [[PostgreSQL Replication Slot]]. So in this sense [[Debezium]] acts as a replica to [[PostgreSQL]] it can detect [[PostgreSQL WAL]] events without putting load on the database. [[Debezium]] also can have selective per-table basis [[PostgreSQL Replication Slot]].
- [[PGStream]] will be working like [[Debezium]] by using a [[PostgreSQL Replication Slot]] to listen for [[PostgreSQL]] changes.
