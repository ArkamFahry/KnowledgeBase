- The [[Perfect Database]] is not really a [[Database]] it should be more like Distributed State Engine ([[DSE]]). Which holds application state fault tolerantly in a distributed manner even between applications. The [[DSE]] has the ability to work as an advance DB which can literally keep all the client's in sync without any extra configuration. Rather than the traditional way of polling for changes this type of system keeps all the client's in sync reactively making this type of system faster and more ergonomic to work with. Also with this we can bring DB [[ACID]] like guarantees up to the client meaning a data changes on the DB are shown to the client with high level accuracy in real-time removing whole class of consistency and reactivity problems.
